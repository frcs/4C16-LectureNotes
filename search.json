The mathematical material is aimed at students in their fourth or fifth year of University.\nLabs associated with this module use the Keras framework and Python. If you are not very familiar with programming, the Non-Programmer’s Tutorial for Python, is a good, gentle introduction to the programming language. Only the first 13 chapters are of interest for the course. If you prefer learning from videos, we recommend the ‘Introduction to Computer Science and Programming’ course from MIT. These don’t move too fast and are properly rigorous.\nThere is no need to install Python on your own computer. It is sufficient and simpler to use an online Python environment. For simple python code, you can try https://repl.it/languages/python3. Copy-and-paste (or type in) example code into the white pane on the left, and click ‘run’; you will see the output, if any, on the right. For running deep learning code, we recommend Google’s excellent colab, which offers a jupyter notebook environment and allows you train most networks.",

    "text": "Welcome to 4C16. When this module began in 2017, the shockwave from the AlexNet paper four years prior was still reverberating through the research community. We were the first to offer a dedicated Deep Learning module in Ireland, driven by a sense of urgency to keep pace with what looked liked an ongoing revolution.\nThe essence of Deep Learning is relatively easy to comprehend. I have a slide deck for introducing Deep Learning in 5 minutes, another for Convolutional Neural Networks in 5 minutes, and a third for Large Language Models, also in 5 minutes. In less than half an hour, a secondary school student could realistically grasp its core mechanisms. But we need to delve deeper in its foundations.\nThus, from its inception, our philosophy for 4C16 was clear: to train practitioners with a deep understanding of both the mathematical foundations and the practical application of Deep Learning. We knew our students would come from diverse backgrounds—some with stronger coding skills, some more confortable with the mathematical foundations; the challenge was to create a curriculum that could suit everyone.\nTo bridge the gap between theory and practice for everyone, we engineered our own solution: a sophisticated, in-house learning web platform. This system provides students with seamless access to the Google Cloud Platform (now Colab), through a web-based terminal and Jupyter environment. The labs, built on the Keras framework, are automatically assessed via Git, providing instant, formative feedback. This platform was our answer to the challenge of scalability and quality, and nearly a decade later, it remains the robust bedrock of our teaching and remains without equal.\nOf course, both the field and the module have evolved significantly. Looking back at the first year’s introductory handout, my focus was on stressing that this was a revolution. In 2017, some were still doubtful, viewing Deep Learning as just another fad that would be superseded by the next shiny Machine Learning method. But even then, the signs of a profound paradigm shift were visible, and I felt they needed to be explicitly stated. Today, the importance of the topic needs no justification, and the same slides now serve as a brief historical reminder.\nAs Deep Learning has advanced, so has 4C16. In 2020, the module expanded from 5 to 10 ECTS, and the curriculum has progressively integrated critical new topics, including Variational Autoencoders, Transformers, Large Language Models. The emergence of generative AI, has not only become a topic of study but has also impacted the module delivery itself.\nToday, the field of Deep Learning has reached a certain maturity. It may no longer be the raw, unexplored frontier it was in 2017, but it has become a vast and indispensable territory in science and engineering. Its mathematical principles draw from statistics, signal processing, computer vision, and linguistics, making it a truly interdisciplinary pursuit. This module, 4C16, has matured alongside it and now serves as an essential foundation, with more advanced topics branching into specialised modules like EEP55C34.\nFrançois Pitié",

    "text": "Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and A.I.\nAs you begin this module, you are witnessing a pivotal moment in a technological and societal revolution, one driven by what is now universally called Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, how we arrived at this term is a curious trajectory. Around We started around 2012-2013, with the term Deep Learning (DL). Soon after, the broader and more established academic term Machine Learning (ML) became more common. Today, we have largely settled on AI, a catch-all term that is now globally used. Let us untangle these terms. They are not interchangeable; rather, they represent a nested hierarchy of concepts.\nArtificial Intelligence is the broadest and oldest concept, born in the 1950s. The original ambition was to create machines capable of human-like intelligence in its entirety—reasoning, planning, learning, and natural language understanding. For decades, the dominant approach to AI, often called “Symbolic AI” or “Good Old-Fashioned AI” (GOFAI), relied on explicitly programming computers with hand-coded rules and logic. The machine was “intelligent” because a human had manually encoded knowledge and decision-making processes into it.\nBeginning in the 1980s and gaining significant momentum through the 1990s and 2000s, a fundamentally different approach emerged: Machine Learning (ML).\nAt its heart, ML is about fitting mathematical models to data, a concept you’ve likely already encountered in statistics with good old regression. In regression, the goal is to find the parameters (e.g., the slope m and intercept b for a line y=mx+b) that create the best possible fit to your data. Machine Learning generalises this powerful idea. Instead of just lines, we can work with far more complex models, but the principle is the same: we use data to tune the model’s parameters automatically. Rather than explicitly programming rules, we let the machine discover the rules by learning the patterns directly from examples. This data-driven approach is a significant cultural and methodological shift.\nWhile we often think of “machine learning” as a term from computer science, the underlying principles and techniques have been developed across many disciplines. For anyone working with numerical data, the need for analytical tools is universal. Many fields, including statistics and signal processing, have contributed to and benefited from the development of these methods. This interdisciplinary nature has led to some political friction. For instance, many statisticians might view much of modern ML as “applied statistics” or refer to it as Statistical Learning, emphasising its deep roots in their field.\nThis brings us to the focus of this module: Deep Learning (DL). Deep Learning is a specific subfield of Machine Learning. It is not a new idea—its core concepts have existed for decades, with scientists such as McCulloch and Pitts (1943), Rosenblatt (1958) and Joseph (1960) introducing the ideas of artificial neurons, perceptrons, and multilayer perceptrons. But it remained an essentially fringe domain for decades and it is only in the 2010s that it became a practical and dominant method.\nThe defining feature of Deep Learning is its use of deep Artificial Neural Networks—architectures with multiple layers of interconnected nodes, loosely inspired by the structure of the human brain.\nThe relationship between these fields can be summarised as:\n\\text{Deep Learning} \\subset \\text{Machine Learning}  \\subset \\text{AI}\nNote that while deep learning was technically always a part of the broader AI research field, it was a fringe area, and its major breakthrough papers happened first in the fields of computer vision, image processing, audio processing and natural language processing, which were external to AI. Their success was so profound that it revitalised the term AI, giving it a new meaning. So much so, that whenever you hear about a AI today—whether in self-driving cars, medical diagnostics, or natural language translation—you can be almost certain that it is, in fact, powered by Deep Learning.",

    "section": "Main Areas of Machine Learning",
    "text": "Main Areas of Machine Learning\nMachine learning itself can be broadly categorised into four main areas, each addressing different types of problems: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Generative Models. Deep Learning has had a major impact on all of them.\n\nSupervised Learning\nSupervised learning is the most common type of machine learning, accounting for a vast majority of research and applications. In supervised learning, we start with a dataset that has been labelled with the correct outcomes. For example, we might have a collection of images, where each image is labeled as either a “dog” or a “cat.” The goal is to train a model that can learn the relationship between the input data (the images) and the corresponding labels.\nMathematically, we have a dataset of n observations, where each observation consists of a feature vector {\\bf x}_i (e.g., the pixels of an image) and a known outcome y_i (e.g., 0 for a dog, 1 for a cat). The task is to learn a function f from that labelled dataset ({\\bf x}_i, y_i)_{i=1,\\dots,n} that can predict the outcome for a new, unseen input: f({\\bf x}_j, {\\bf\nw})=y_j. This is achieved by estimating the parameters {\\bf w} of the model f({\\bf x}, {\\bf w}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of Supervised Learning Task: Image Classification\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning\nIn unsupervised learning, the goal is to find patterns and structure in a dataset ({\\bf x}_i) without the help of any pre-existing labels. A common application is clustering, where the algorithm groups similar data points together. For example, an e-commerce website could use clustering to segment its customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. These clusters can then be used for targeted marketing campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example of Unsupervised Learning Task: Clustering\n\n\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning\nReinforcement learning (RL) is about training an agent to make a sequence of decisions in an environment to maximise a cumulative reward. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. RL is the basis for training models to play games like chess and Go, as well as for robotics applications where a robot learns to navigate its surroundings. While powerful, RL can be complex and data-intensive to implement, which is why it is less common than supervised or unsupervised learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reinforcement Learning\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative Models\nGenerative models are a rapidly advancing area of machine learning focused on creating new content. These models learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and can then generate new samples that are similar to the original data. This includes generating realistic images, writing human-like text, and composing music.\nMathematically, we try to model the conditional probability of the observable {\\bf x}, given a target y: {\\bf x} \\sim p({\\bf x}| y). This is your ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusions, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Example of Generative AI with DALLE2 (Mar 2022)\n\n\n\nDeep Learning has made major breakthroughs in all four of these fields. As a result, neural networks have become the dominant tool in virtually all areas of machine learning research.",

    "section": "Early Deep Learning Successes",
    "text": "Early Deep Learning Successes\n\nImage Classification\nThe story of Deep Learning’s success began in 2012 with Image Classification, also known as Image Recognition. This core task in Computer Vision is arguably the birthplace of modern Deep Learning. For years, image recognition was a notoriously difficult problem. The prevailing approach involved manually engineering a set of image features and then feeding them into a classification algorithm. The 2014 comic from xkcd illustrates this challenge:\n\n\n\nhttps://xkcd.com/1425/ (2014)\n\n\nThe ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is an annual competition which benchmarks the performance of image recognition algorithms. Before 2012, methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were the top performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: ImageNet image classification challenge.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, a deep learning model called AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) dramatically reduced the error rate for object recognition, capturing the attention of the computer vision community and beyond. While neural networks had existed for decades, the scale of this improvement was undeniable. Since then, every winning entry in the ImageNet competition has been based on a deep neural network, with each year bringing further incremental progress. Today, machines have surpassed human performance on this specific task. In 2014, Andrej Karpathy, then a PhD student, manually classified a subset of the ImageNet dataset and achieved a 5% error rate. For comparison, the winning entry in 2022 had an error rate of less than 1%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Historical error Rates at ImageNet’s classification challenge between 2010 and 2015. (see full leaderboard)\n\n\n\n\n\nScene Understanding\nThe advancements in image recognition quickly spread to related fields like Scene Understanding. The figure below shows the results of Mask R-CNN (He et al. 2017), a deep learning model that can perform semantic segmentation. This means it can classify every pixel in an image, associating it with a specific object class like “human,” “train,” or “car.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Results from Mask R-CNN. (He et al. 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Captioning\nBy 2014, researchers were combining deep learning models for vision and language to automatically generate captions for images. A single, end-to-end neural network could now take an image as input and produce a descriptive sentence as output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Results of automated image captioning (Vinyals et al. 2015). See Google Research blog entry\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine Translation\nThe deep learning revolution also transformed the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By 2014, major tech companies were replacing their existing machine translation systems with deep learning models. Google, for example, had been seeing an average annual improvement of 0.4% on its translation service. Their first implementation of a deep learning-based system resulted in a 7% improvement overnight—more than the cumulative progress of a decade of work. This story is detailed in the New York Times article, “The Great AI Awakening”.\nYears of handcrafted feature engineering were rendered obsolete overnight by a simple deep learning model.\nSince then, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has further revolutionised text processing. These models, with hundreds of billions of parameters, are trained on vast amounts of text from the internet, often in multiple languages.\nWith the release of OpenAI’s GPT-3 in June of 2020, the revolution went mainstream. GPT-3 became a household name and brought the capabilities of LLMs to a global audience.\n\n\nMultimedia Content\nDeep Learning has become a universal tool for applications that involve multiple types of media. As early as 2014, Microsoft show cased how speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis could be combined into a single, seamless experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nSkype demo\nMicrosoft blog post\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Playing\nDeep learning has also been successfully applied to reinforcement learning, enabling the solution of complex sequential decision-making problems. This has led to remarkable achievements, such as training agents to play Atari games, controlling real-world robots, and defeating human champions at the game of Go. In March 2016, the victory of DeepMind’s AlphaGo over the world’s top Go, Lee Sedol, was a landmark event in the history of A.I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\ndemo: Robots Learning how to walk\nDeepMind",

    "text": "Reasons for Success\nNeural networks have been around for decades, but by 2013 that they started to surpass all other machine learning techniques. Deep learning has become a disruptive technology that has fundamentally changed the operations of technology companies worldwide. This is not an overstatement.\n\n``The revolution in deep nets has been very profound, it definitely surprised me, even though I was sitting right there.’’.\n— Sergey Brin, Google co-founder\n\nSo, why then?\nThe key reason is that Deep Learning scales.\nNeural networks are unique in their ability to improve their performance with increasing amounts of data. As illustrated in the now classic explanation diagram of Figure 10, other machine learning techniques, which were popular before, do not scale as effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Classic illustration showing how Deep Learning surpassed other previous classic machine learning methods on large datasets.\n\n\n\nThe availability of massive datasets and the development of powerful, low-cost computing hardware (especially Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs) created the perfect conditions for deep learning to flourish. While other methods plateaued, deep learning models could continue to improve by training on billions of examples instead of just thousands.\nThe tipping point for computer vision was in 2012, and for machine translation, it was around 2014.\n\nGlobal Reach\nSince these early successes, deep learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of fields in research, industry, and society. Some examples include: self-driving cars, medical image analysis for cancer detection, speech recognition and synthesis, drug discovery and toxicology (see DeepMind’s AlphaFold project), customer relationship management, recommendation systems, bioinformatics, advertising, and even controlling lasers.\n\n\nGenericity and Systematicity\nOne of the most significant advantages of deep learning is its capacity to automatically learn features directly from data. This capability often allows it to surpass the performance of traditional, approaches that require extensive time and expert knowledge to create useful features from the data. In the early days of deep learning, it was common for even a simple master’s project to beat complex, state-of-the-art algorithms from teams of world experts on its first attempt. This made deep learning a powerful and generalisable approach for solving problems across a wide range of domains.\n\n\nSimplicity and Democratisation\nDeep learning provides a relatively simple and flexible framework for defining and optimising a wide range of models. With modern deep learning libraries, programmers can train state-of-the-art neural networks without needing a decade of research experience in the field. Furthermore, modern AI toolchains, allow developers to build sophisticated software solutions using simple natural language prompts. In fact, coders might not be needed anymore, all you need to do is to write some text. This has created new opportunities for startups and has made A.I. a ubiquitous tool in the industry.\n\n\nImpact\nThe rapid progress of A.I. raises important questions about the future of work. How long will it be before your job can be automated by an algorithm? Even creative professions are no longer immune.\nFor example, early deep learning models (2015) could already perform style transfer, applying the artistic style of one image to another:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Automatic style transfer, based on (Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge 2015)\n\n\n\nNow large-scale models like DALL·E 2 (Ramesh et al. 2022) can generate incredibly creative and high-quality images from text descriptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: OpenAI’s DALL·E 2’s picture creation from a text description: “Teddy bears mixing sparkling chemicals as mad scientists as a 1990s Saturday morning cartoon” (see https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nA Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style.

    "title": "1  Linear Regression and Least Squares",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 The Linear Model and Notations\nThis chapter marks the beginning of our journey into Machine Learning (ML), and we start with a familiar topic: Linear Regression, which is most commonly solved using the method of Least Squares (LS). While many of you will have encountered Least Squares before, our goal here is not so much to provide a primer. Instead, we will revisit this classical technique through the modern lens of Machine Learning.\nIt is often forgotten, but Least Squares can be considered the original Machine Learning algorithm. By examining it, we can introduce many of the fundamental concepts that form the bedrock of modern ML. These include the distinction between training and testing data, the challenges of overfitting and underfitting, the role of regularisation, the modelling of noise and the concept of a loss function. Understanding these ideas is key, as they are central to virtually all Machine Learning techniques we will explore.\nThe method of least squares has its origins in astronomy, where it was developed to calculate the orbits of celestial bodies. It is often credited to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who published it in 1809, but it was first described by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805. The priority dispute arose from Gauss’s claim to have been using the method since 1795.\nLet us begin with a simple, practical example. Imagine we have collected data on the height and weight of a group of people, as shown in Figure 1.2. Our goal is to build a model that can predict a person’s weight based on their height.\nIn the language of Machine Learning, we define the following:\ny = w_0 + w_1 x_{1} + w_2 x_{2} + w_3 x_{3} +\n\\cdots + w_p x_{p}\nFor our height-weight example, a well-fitting model might look like this:\n\\mathrm{weight (kg)} = 0.972 \\times \\mathrm{height (cm)} - 99.5\nThe parameters of the model, (w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_p), are called the weights. The term w_0 is often called the bias or intercept. The mathematical notations used here are strongly established conventions in Machine Learning, and we will adhere to them throughout this module. Note, however, that ML is an interdisciplinary field, and conventions can sometimes conflict. For instance, in Statistics, the model parameters are instead denoted as \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p.\nLet us formalise the problem. We have a dataset consisting of n observations. For each observation i, we have a vector of p features (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\dots, x_{ip}) and a corresponding output y_i. The linear model for each observation is:\n\\begin{aligned}\n    y_1  &= w_0 + w_1 x_{11} + w_2 x_{12} + \\cdots + w_p x_{1p} +\n    \\varepsilon_1 \\\\\n    y_2  &= w_0 + w_1 x_{21} + w_2 x_{22} + \\cdots + w_p x_{2p} +\n    \\varepsilon_2  \\\\\n    & \\vdots & \\\\\n    y_n  &= w_0 + w_1 x_{n1} + w_2 x_{n2} + \\cdots  + w_p x_{np} +\n    \\varepsilon_n\n  \\end{aligned}\nAgain, we will stick to these notations throughout the module and n will always represent the number of observations/number of points in your dataset, and p the number of features.\nSince a simple linear model cannot perfectly capture the complexity of the real world, we have introduced an error term, \\varepsilon_i, for each observation. This term represents the difference between our model’s prediction and the actual observed value y_i.\nOur objective is to find the set of weights (w_0, w_1, \\cdots, w_p) that makes the errors as small as possible. However, the errors (\\varepsilon_1, \\dots, \\varepsilon_n) form a vector, and we cannot directly minimise a vector. We need to aggregate these n error values into a single scalar quantity that we can compare and use for optimisation.\nIn Least Squares, this is achieved using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is the average of the squared errors:\nE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\varepsilon_i^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( w_0 + w_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots  + w_p x_{ip} - y_i \\right)^2\nThe choice of the Mean Squared Error is the defining aspect of Least Squares. While other metrics are possible (such as the mean absolute difference), the MSE is mathematically convenient and, as we will see, has a deep probabilistic justification. In Machine Learning, the function that measures the model’s error is called the loss function. Our goal is to find the weights that minimise this loss function.",

    "text": "1.2 Optimisation\nTo find the optimal values for the weights (w_0, \\dots, w_p) that minimise the MSE, we can use calculus. The MSE, E(w_0, \\dots, w_p), is a convex function of the weights. Therefore, its minimum occurs where its gradient is zero; that is, where all its partial derivatives with respect to each weight are equal to zero.\n\n  \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_0} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_1} = 0, \\quad \\cdots, \\quad \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_p} = 0\n\nLet us compute these partial derivatives for our MSE loss function: \n  E(w_0,\\cdots,w_p) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( w_0 + w_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots  + w_p x_{ip} - y_i \\right)^2\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial  w_0} &= \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( w_0 + w_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + w_p x_{ip} - y_i \\right) = 0\n    \\\\\n    \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_1} &= \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i1} \\left( w_0 + w_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + w_p x_{ip} - y_i \\right) = 0 \\\\\n    & \\vdots   \\\\\n    \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_p} &= \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ip}\n    \\left( w_0 + w_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + w_p x_{ip} - y_i \\right) = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\nRearranging these terms and dividing by 2/n, we obtain a system of p+1 linear equations in p+1 unknowns (w_0, \\dots, w_p):\n\\begin{alignat*}{5}\n    & w_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n 1\n    && + w_1 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1}\n    && +\\cdots\n    && + w_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ip}\n    && = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\\n    & w_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1}\n    && + w_1 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1}^2\n    && +\\cdots\n    && + w_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1}x_{ip}\n    && = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1} y_i \\\\\n    &  && \\vdots && \\vdots && \\vdots && \\vdots \\\\\n    & w_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ip}\n    && + w_1 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ip}x_{i1}\n    && +\\cdots\n    && + w_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ip}^2\n    && = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ip} y_i\n\\end{alignat*}\nThis system of equations can be solved efficiently using standard linear algebra methods.\n\n1.2.1 Matrix Notation\nWhile the summation notation is explicit, it quickly becomes cumbersome. Deriving these equations using matrix notation is more elegant. By convention, we denote scalars with a lowercase letter (y), vectors with a bold lowercase letter (\\mathbf{w}), and matrices with a bold uppercase letter (\\mathbf{X}).\nLet us define the following: \n  \\mathbf {y} =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  y_{1}\\\\ y_{2}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{n}\n  \\end{pmatrix},\n  \\,\n  \\mathbf {x}_i =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 \\\\ x_{i1}\\\\ x_{i2}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{ip}\n  \\end{pmatrix},\n  \\,\n  \\mathbf{w} =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  w_{0} \\\\ w_{1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ w_{p}\n  \\end{pmatrix},\n  \\,\n  \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\varepsilon_{1}\\\\\n    \\varepsilon_{2}\\\\\n    \\vdots \\\\\n    \\varepsilon_{n}\n    \\end{pmatrix},\n\nTo handle the bias w_0 as any of the other weights, we have augmented the feature vector with a made-up feature x_{i0}=1. Doing this allows us to write our model in a compact way:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= w_0 \\times 1 + w_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + w_p x_{ip} + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n& = \\mathbf {x}_i ^T\\mathbf {w} + \\varepsilon_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\nWe can combine this for all observations by introducing the matrix \\mathbf{X}, which contains all our input features for all n observations:\n\n  \\mathbf{X} =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & x_{11} & \\cdots & x_{1p} \\\\\n  1 & x_{21} & \\cdots & x_{2p} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  1 & x_{n1} & \\cdots & x_{np}\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the first column of ones is included to accommodate the bias term w_0. This important matrix is known as the Design Matrix.\nUsing these definitions, our entire system of n linear equations can be written compactly as: \n    \\mathbf {y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n\nThe MSE loss function can also be expressed neatly in matrix form. The sum of squared errors, \\sum \\varepsilon_i^2, is equivalent to the squared Euclidean norm of the error vector, ||\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}||^2, which can be written as the dot product \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}.\n\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    E(\\mathbf{w}) &= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\varepsilon_i^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\top}\n    \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} =  \\frac{1}{n} || \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} ||^2 \\\\\n     &= \\frac{1}{n} ( \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf {y} )^{\\top} (\n    \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf {y} ) \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{n} ( \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - 2 \\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf {y} + \\mathbf {y}^{\\top}\\mathbf {y} )\n  \\end{aligned}\n\nTo find the minimum of E(\\mathbf{w}), we need to compute its gradient with respect to the vector \\mathbf{w}, denoted \\nabla_{\\mathbf{w}} E or \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}, and set it to the zero vector. \n  \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{w}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_0}, \\cdots,\n  \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_p} \\right)^{\\top} = \\mathbf{0}\n\nKnowing a few standard results for vector calculus is very useful. Below is a list of common matrix derivative identities, assuming that \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf {A} are independent of \\mathbf {w}.\n\\begin{alignat*}{3}\n    & {\\frac {\\partial {\\mathbf{a}}^{\\top }{\\mathbf {w}}}{\\partial\n          {\\mathbf {w}}}} &&= {\\mathbf {a}} &&\n  \\\\ & {\\frac {\\partial {\\mathbf {b}}^{\\top }{\\mathbf {A}}{\\mathbf\n          {w}}}{\\partial {\\mathbf {w}}}} && = {\\mathbf {A}}^{\\top }{\\mathbf {b}}\n    && \\\\ & {\\frac {\\partial {\\mathbf {w}}^{\\top }{\\mathbf\n          {A}}{\\mathbf {w}}}{\\partial {\\mathbf {w}}}} && = ({ \\mathbf\n      {A}}+{\\mathbf {A}}^{\\top }){ \\mathbf {w}} && \\quad \\text{(or $2\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{w}$ if A is symmetric)} \\\\ & \\frac\n    {\\partial {\\mathbf {w}}^{\\top }{\\mathbf {w}}}{\\partial {\\mathbf {w}}} && =\n    2{\\mathbf {w}} && \\\\ & {\\frac {\\partial \\;{\\mathbf {a}}^{\\top }{\\mathbf\n          {w}}{\\mathbf {w}}^{\\top }{\\mathbf {b}}}{\\partial \\;{\\mathbf {w}}}} &&\n    = ({\\mathbf {a}}{\\mathbf {b}}^{\\top }+{\\mathbf {b}}{\\mathbf {a}}^{\\top\n    }){\\mathbf {w}} && \\\\\n  \\end{alignat*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCompute the gradient \\frac{\\partial E({\\bf w})}{\\partial {\\bf w}} for E({\\bf w}) = ({\\bf w}-{\\bf B}{\\bf w})^{\\top} {\\bf A} ({\\bf w}-{\\bf a}).\nThere are no assumptions about matrices { \\bf A} and { \\bf B}.\n\n\nLet us now apply these rules to our loss function: \n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{w} } &= \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{\\partial\n    }{\\partial \\mathbf{w} }  \\left( \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - 2\n    \\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf {y} + \\mathbf {y}^{\\top}\\mathbf {y} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nApplying the formulas to each term (noting that \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X} is symmetric): \n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{w} }  \\left( \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}) \\mathbf{w} \\right)  &= 2 \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} \\\\\n  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{w} }  \\left( \\mathbf {y}^{\\top}\\mathbf {y} \\right)  &= \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{w} }  \\left( -2 \\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf {y} \\right)  &= -2 \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf {y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nCombining these results, we get the gradient: \n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{w} } = \\frac{2}{n}  (\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y})\n\nSetting the gradient to zero gives the normal equations: \n\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}  \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} =  \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}  \\mathbf{y}\n\nThis is the same linear system we derived earlier, but expressed in a much more compact and powerful notation. Assuming the matrix \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X} is invertible, we can solve for the optimal weight vector \\hat{\\mathbf{w}} directly: \n\\hat{\\mathbf{w}} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}",

    "text": "1.3 Least Squares in Practice\nNow that we have derived the theory, let us see how it can be used in practice.\n\n1.3.1 A Simple Affine Example\nLet us return to our initial height-weight example. The model is a simple affine function: y = w_0 + w_1 x. The design matrix \\mathbf{X} stacks the single feature x_i for each person, along with a column of ones for the bias term:\n\n  \\mathbf{X}  =\n  {\\begin{pmatrix} 1&x_{1} \\\\\n      1&x_{2} \\\\\n      \\vdots &\\vdots  \\\\\n      1&x_{n} \\\\\n  \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nThe components of the normal equations are: \n  \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X}  =\n         {\\begin{pmatrix}\n             n & \\sum x_i  \\\\\n             \\sum x_i & \\sum x_i^2 \\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}};\n\\quad\n         \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}  =\n         {\\begin{pmatrix}\n             \\sum y_i \\\\\n             \\sum x_i y_i\n         \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nSolving for \\hat{\\mathbf{w}} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y} with the collected data gives the estimated weights \\hat{\\mathbf{w}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -99.5 \\\\ 0.972 \\end{pmatrix}. This corresponds to the linear model we saw earlier: \n\\mathrm{weight} = 0.972 \\times \\mathrm{height} - 99.5\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Transforming Input Features\nA key aspect is that although the model must be linear in the parameters \\mathbf{w}, it does not have to be linear in the original input features \\mathbf{x}. A model is considered linear if it can be written as a linear combination of functions of the input features: \ny = f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\sum_{i=0}^p w_i \\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})\n where the basis functions \\phi_i(\\mathbf{x}) do not depend on the weights \\mathbf{w}.\nThis means we can fit non-linear relationships by first transforming our raw inputs. For example, we can fit a cubic polynomial model: \ny = w_0 + w_1 x + w_2 x^2 + w_3 x^3\n This is still a linear model in the sense that y is a linear combination of the new features \\phi_0(x)=1, \\phi_1(x)=x, \\phi_2(x)=x^2, and \\phi_3(x)=x^3.\nMany other transformations can be used. For instance, y = w_0 + w_1 \\cos(2\\pi x) + w_2  \\sin(2\\pi x) is also a linear model in the parameters w_0, w_1, w_2, where the feature vector has been transformed to [1, \\cos(2\\pi x), \\sin(2\\pi x)]. In contrast, a model like y = w_0^2 + x is not linear in the parameters, because the term w_0^2 is not linear in w_0.\nSimilarly, we can transform the output variable. For instance, if we have collected 2D points (x_{1i}, x_{2i}) that lie on a circle centred at the origin, we could define a new output y_i = \\sqrt{x_{1i}^2 + x_{2i}^2} and fit a simple model y = w_0 to find the radius.\nThis idea of transforming input features is at the core of many Machine Learning techniques. However, as we will see later in Section 1.8, this practice is not entirely without consequences.\n\n\n1.3.3 Polynomial Fitting\nLet us examine the use of feature transforms in more detail by looking at polynomial fitting, a particularly instructive example for ML. Consider the small dataset (x_i, y_i) plotted below. Let us assume we know that the true relationship is quadratic, of the form: y = w_0 + w_1 x + w_2 x^2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A scatter plot of a small dataset for polynomial fitting, where the ground truth (dotted line) is a quadratic model.\n\n\n\nTo fit this model, we transform our single feature x into a new feature vector [1, x, x^2]. The design matrix \\mathbf{X} becomes: \n  \\mathbf{X}  =\n  {\\begin{pmatrix} 1&x_{1}& x_{1}^2 \\\\\n      1&x_{2}& x_{2}^2 \\\\\n      \\vdots &\\vdots &\\vdots \\\\\n      1&x_{n}& x_{n}^2 \\\\\n  \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nThe components of the normal equations are then: \n  \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X}  =\n         {\\begin{pmatrix}\n             \\sum x_i^0 & \\sum x_i^1 & \\sum x_i^2 \\\\\n             \\sum x_i^1 & \\sum x_i^2 & \\sum x_i^3 \\\\\n             \\sum x_i^2 & \\sum x_i^3 & \\sum x_i^4\n         \\end{pmatrix}}\n;, \\quad\n         \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}  =\n         {\\begin{pmatrix}\n             \\sum y_i x_i^0 \\\\\n             \\sum y_i x_i^1 \\\\\n             \\sum y_i x_i^2\n         \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nSolving for \\hat{\\mathbf{w}} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y} gives the following estimated curve, which matches the ground truth well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Least Squares estimate for a polynomial fit of order 2.",

    "text": "1.5 Overfitting\nNow, let us consider the opposite problem. What if we use a model that is too complex? Let us try to fit a 9th-order polynomial, y = w_0 + w_1 x + \\cdots + w_9 x^9, to our small dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: An example of overfitting. The training error is extremely low (MSE=7.59e-06), but the model will not generalise well.\n\n\n\nThe curve now passes perfectly through every data point, and the training error is virtually zero. However, the model exhibits wild oscillations between the points. It is clear that its predictions for any new data would be very poor. This phenomenon is called overfitting, and it is one of the most fundamental challenges in Machine Learning.\nOverfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing not only the underlying pattern but also the random noise specific to that dataset. The model has high variance and fails to generalise to new, unseen data.\nThis is why we must always evaluate our model on a separate test set—a portion of data that was held out and not used during training. Overfitting is occurring if the model’s error on the training set is very low, but its error on the test set is significantly higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we detect overfitting?\n\n\n\nWe have overfitting when the training error is a poor indicator of a model’s true performance. That is, when the error on the training set is low, but the error on the test set is high.\n\n\nThere are two primary ways to combat overfitting:\n\nUse a simpler model: If the model is too complex for the amount of data available, reducing its complexity (e.g., using a lower-degree polynomial) can prevent it from fitting the noise.\nGet more data: This is almost always the best solution. A larger and more representative dataset will naturally constrain a complex model, forcing it to learn the true underlying pattern. If some features are not useful, their corresponding weights w_i will tend towards zero as more data is provided.\n\nThe figure below shows what happens when we fit the same 9th-order polynomial to a much denser dataset. The fit is now very close to the true quadratic model, and the wild oscillations have disappeared. Thanks to the large amount of data, the estimated weight for the x^9 term is now close to zero (w_9=\\small -1.83\\!\\times\\!\n10^{-8}), as it should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Higher-order models do not necessarily overfit if there is sufficient data (MSE: 7.18e-01).\n\n\n\nNote that a small amount of overfitting is not always a bad thing. One would expect a model to perform better on examples it has seen many times before. In practice, some gap between training and test performance is normal, and aggressively avoiding it might lead to underfitting.",

    "text": "1.6 Regularisation\nWhat if we cannot get more data? While this may sometimes be a poor excuse, there are situations where data is genuinely scarce or expensive. In such cases, a go-to technique called regularisation can be used to control overfitting.\nFor Least Squares, a common regularisation technique is Tikhonov regularisation, also known as Ridge Regression or L2 regularisation. The idea is to add a penalty term to the loss function that discourages the model weights from becoming too large.\nInstead of minimising the standard MSE, || \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{y} ||^2, we minimise a modified loss: \nE_{\\text{reg}}(\\mathbf{w}) = || \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{y} ||^2 + \\alpha || \\mathbf{w} ||^2\n where || \\mathbf{w} ||^2 = w_0^2 + w_1^2 + \\cdots + w_p^2 is the squared L2-norm of the weight vector, and \\alpha &gt; 0 is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the regularisation.\nThe effect of this penalty is to introduce a bias that pulls the estimated weights \\mathbf{w} towards zero. The motivation is that, all else being equal, simpler models with smaller weights are generally more plausible. For example, the model \n\\mathrm{weight} = 0.972 \\times \\mathrm{height} - 99.5\n is a priori more likely to be correct than a model like \n\\mathrm{weight} = 10^{10} \\times \\mathrm{height} - 10^{20}\n even if both produce a similar prediction error on the training data. Regularisation helps us favour the former.\nRegularisation is often a necessary tool, but it is not a magic bullet. It helps prevent wild predictions for inputs far from the training data, but it does so by introducing a bias into the estimate. It should be seen as a way to incorporate prior beliefs into our model, not as a substitute for sufficient data.\nAdding the Tikhonov regularisation term still yields a closed-form solution, which is a convenient property: \n\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}_{\\text{reg}} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X} + \\alpha \\mathbf{I})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}\n where \\mathbf{I} is the identity matrix.\nNumerically, overfitting often arises because the problem is ill-posed or under-constrained, causing the matrix \\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X} to be singular (non-invertible) or poorly conditioned. Adding the term \\alpha \\mathbf{I} ensures that the matrix is always invertible, thus stabilising the solution. Of course, a better way to make the problem well-posed is to have enough data to properly constrain it.\nSo, go and get more data!",

    "section": "1.7 The Maximum Likelihood Perspective",
    "text": "1.7 The Maximum Likelihood Perspective\nVery early on, Gauss established a deep connection between Least Squares, the principles of probability, and the Gaussian (or Normal) distribution. This provides a probabilistic justification for using the Mean Squared Error as our loss function.\nRecall our linear model: \n  \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n\nWe can adopt a probabilistic view by making an explicit assumption about the nature of the error term \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}. Let us assume that the errors are drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and some variance \\sigma^2. \n\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\n The probability density function (pdf) for a single error term is: \np(\\varepsilon_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: The probability density function of the Normal distribution.\n\n\n\nGiven this assumption, we can calculate the likelihood of observing a particular output y_i given the input \\mathbf{x}_i and model weights \\mathbf{w}. Since \\varepsilon_i = y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w}, this is: \np(y_i|\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\nAssuming that all n observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the likelihood of observing the entire dataset (\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}) is the product of the individual likelihoods: \n\\begin{aligned}\np(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) &= \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i|\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{w}) \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\right)^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w})^2\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) states that we should choose the parameters \\mathbf{w} that make our observed data most probable. That is, we want to find the \\mathbf{w} that maximises the likelihood function p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}): \n\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}_{\\text{ML}} = \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf{w}} p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w})\n\nFor practical reasons, it is easier to work with the logarithm of the likelihood, as this turns the product into a sum and does not change the location of the maximum. Maximising the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimising the negative log-likelihood: \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}_{\\text{ML}} &= \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w}}\n- \\log(p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w})) \\\\\n&= \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w}} - \\log\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\right)^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w})^2\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&= \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w}} \\left( n \\log(\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}) + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w})^2 \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nSince the terms n, \\log(\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}), and 2\\sigma^2 are positive constants with respect to \\mathbf{w}, minimising this expression is equivalent to minimising: \n\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}_{\\text{ML}} = \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w}} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w})^2\n\nThis is precisely the same objective function as in the method of Least Squares. This remarkable result shows that the Least Squares estimate is identical to the Maximum Likelihood solution under the assumption of i.i.d. Gaussian noise. This establishes a fundamental link between the choice of a loss function and the implicit assumptions we make about the data’s error distribution.\nChoosing the MSE loss is equivalent to assuming that the prediction error is normally distributed. If we were to choose a different loss function, it would correspond to a different assumption about the noise. For instance, choosing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss, \\sum |y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w}|, is equivalent to assuming the error follows a Laplace distribution.\nIn conclusion, the choice of loss function should ideally be driven by our knowledge of the data-generating process. In practice, however, the choice is often guided by a combination of empirical performance on a test set and the mathematical convenience of optimisation.",

    "section": "1.8 Loss, Feature Transforms, and Noise",
    "text": "1.8 Loss, Feature Transforms, and Noise\nHere are a few examples to illustrate the intricate relationships between the loss function, feature transformations, and noise characteristics.\n\n1.8.1 Example 1: Regression Towards the Mean\nConsider the case where our input measurements themselves are noisy. The model is: \ny = (x + \\nu) w + \\epsilon\n where \\nu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_\\nu^2) is noise in the measurement of the feature x, and \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon^2) is the usual observation noise. The total prediction error is now \\epsilon + w\\nu, which critically depends on the parameter w we are trying to estimate. This is no longer a textbook application of Least Squares.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1.9, applying standard Least Squares in this scenario will result in an estimated slope \\hat{w} that is biased towards zero. This is because reducing the magnitude of w not only fits the data but also minimises the variance of the noise term w\\nu. This phenomenon is a common source of surprising results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: An example of Regression Towards the Mean. The dashed green line shows the true relationship (y=x). The solid red line is the LS estimate, which is biased towards zero.\n\n\n\nIn fact, this problem is the origin of the term regression itself. In his 1886 paper, “Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature,” Francis Galton used Least Squares to compare the heights of parents and their adult children. He observed that tall parents tended to have children who were shorter than them, and short parents tended to have children who were taller. His linear fit had a slope \\hat{w} &lt; 1, indicating a “regression to the mean.” The explanation is that both sets of heights are noisy measurements of an underlying genetic predisposition, leading to the bias we have described.\nThis issue does not arise if the features are known precisely. For instance, if x is a timestamp in a time series, there is no uncertainty, and it is safe to apply LS and any feature transformations.\n\n\n1.8.2 Example 2: Non-linear Transformations\nConsider the following non-linear model with additive Gaussian noise: \ny = x_1^{w_1} + \\epsilon\n where \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1). The model is not linear in the parameters. However, we can linearise it by taking the logarithm of both sides and transforming the features: \n\\begin{aligned}\n   y' & =  \\log(y) \\\\\n   x_1' & =  \\log(x_1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThis leads to a model that is linear in the weights: \ny' = w_1 x_1' + \\epsilon'\n However, the error term \\epsilon' is now also a transformed version of the original error \\epsilon. Using a first-order Taylor approximation, \\log(t + \\epsilon) \\approx \\log(t) + \\epsilon/t, we find that: \n\\epsilon' \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{x_1^{w_1}}\n The new error term \\epsilon' is no longer independent of the features and weights, and its variance is not constant. This violates the assumptions of standard Least Squares, and applying it to the transformed problem is likely to produce biased estimates.\nSo, while feature transformations are a powerful tool, it is important to remember that they can alter the statistical properties of the noise, potentially leading to unexpected biases in the results.",

    "text": "1.9 Takeaways\nThis chapter has revisited Linear Regression from a Machine Learning perspective. The key takeaways are:\n\nWe start with a collection of n training examples, (\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i). Each example consists of a feature vector \\mathbf{x}_i and a target value y_i.\nWe postulate a model that is linear in a set of parameters or weights \\mathbf{w}, such that our prediction is \\hat{y}_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\top}\\mathbf{w}.\nWe define a loss function to quantify the discrepancy between our predictions and the true values. For least squares, this is the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\nWe find the optimal weights \\hat{\\mathbf{w}} by minimising the loss function. For MSE, this leads to a closed-form solution known as the normal equations.\nMinimising the MSE loss is equivalent to finding the Maximum Likelihood solution under the assumption that the observation errors are independent and identically distributed according to a Gaussian distribution.\nUnderfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying data patterns. It can be addressed by using a more complex model.\nOverfitting occurs when the model is too complex and learns the noise in the training data, failing to generalise to a separate test set. It can be addressed by using more data or by using regularisation.\nWe can fit non-linear relationships by transforming the input features. However, we must be mindful that these transformations can affect the noise distribution and cause biases in our estimates.",

    "text": "2.1 A Motivating Example: Predicting Exam Success\nIn the previous chapter, we explored Linear Regression, that can model problems where the output is a continuous variable, such as a price, temperature, or height. However, many real-world problems require us to make a categorical choice, where we need to build a classifier that can answer questions like: Is this email spam or not? Does this patient have a particular disease? Which category does this news article belong to?\nThis chapter introduces Logistic Regression (Cox 1958), a fundamental algorithm for tackling binary classification problems, where the outcome is one of two categories (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false, pass or fail). Despite its name, logistic regression is a model for classification, not regression.\nThere is a vast ecosystem of classification algorithms, so why focus on this one? The reason is that logistic regression is not just a workhorse classifier in its own right; it is also the foundational building block of modern neural networks. Understanding it thoroughly will pave the way for the more complex deep learning models we will encounter later.\nLet us start with a simple, intuitive example, adapted from Wikipedia:\nThe collected data consists of pairs of (Hours Studied, Result), where the result is binary: 1 for a pass and 0 for a fail.\nOur goal is to build a model that, given a number of hours studied, can predict the outcome.",

Although the output y is binary (0 or 1), we could still attempt to fit a straight line to the data using least squares.\n\n  y \\approx {\\bf x}^{\\top}{\\bf w}\n\nFor our simple 1D problem, the feature vector is {\\bf x}^{\\top} = [1, x] (where x is hours studied) and the weights are {\\bf w}^{\\top} = [w_0, w_1]. The least squares fit is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A linear regression fit to the binary classification data.\n\n\n\nThe line produces continuous values, not the 0s and 1s we need.\nWe could convert the output into a binary classification by applying a threshold, for instance at 0.5:\n\n  \\hat{y} = [ {\\bf x}^{\\top}{\\bf w} &gt; 0.5  ] =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{ if ${\\bf x}^{\\top}{\\bf w} &gt; 0.5$} \\\\\n    0 & \\text{ otherwise}\n  \\end{cases}\n\nHowever, this approach has a fundamental flaw. Linear regression’s loss function (MSE) tries to minimise the squared distance between the line and the data points. Consider a student who studied for 6 hours and passed. Their data point is at (6, 1). The line’s prediction might be, say, 1.2. The squared error is (1 - 1.2)^2 = 0.04. Now consider a student who studied for 10 hours and also passed. The line’s prediction might be 2.0. The squared error is (1 - 2.0)^2 = 1.0. The model is heavily penalised for this second student, even though the prediction (pass) is clearly correct.\nThis means that outliers or even correctly classified but distant points can disproportionately influence the position of the line, pulling it away from what might be a better decision boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Adding a clear-cut data point (6.2 hours, Pass) distorts the LS fit (dotted magenta) because the model tries to minimise the large error for this point.\n\n\n\nThe core issue is that we optimised the model to make {\\bf\nx}^{\\top}{\\bf w} match y, when we should have optimised it to make our classification rule [ {\\bf x}^{\\top}{\\bf w} &gt; 0.5 ] match y.

    "text": "2.3 A Probabilistic View of Classification with Generalised Linear Models\nLet us reframe the problem. Instead of predicting the outcome directly, let us try to predict the probability of the outcome. Specifically, we want to model the conditional probability p(y=1 | {\\bf x}, {\\bf w}).\nSetting the threshold at 0, we want to use the core model:\n\n  y = [ {\\bf x}^{\\top}{\\bf w} + \\epsilon &gt; 0  ]\n\nThe term {\\bf x}^{\\top}{\\bf w}, often called the logit or score, provides a measure of evidence for the positive class. The score can range from -\\infty (very likely to be y=-1) to +\\infty (very likely to be y=1). A score of 0 indicates that we are undecided between both options.\nIn our toy example, the risk score is just a re-scaled version of the number of hours studied. For instance, if you study less than 1 hour your are very likely to fail. In the general case, the risk operates a dimensional reduction. That is, it combines multiple input values into a single score, that can then be used for comparison. Think of a buyer’s guide that combines multiple evaluations to form a single score.\nThe key to general linear models is the idea that the uncertainty (\\varepsilon) is on the risk score itself, not directly on the outcome. That is, the error on the risk score might move the ultimate decision to either side of the threshold boundary.\nWe can now, like in Least Squares, take a probabilistic view of the problem and try to model/approximate the distribution of \\epsilon with a known distribution.\nMultiple choices are possible for the distribution of \\epsilon. In logistic regression, the error \\epsilon is assumed to follow a logistic distribution and the risk score {\\bf x}^{\\top} {\\bf y} is also called the logit.\nIn probit regression, the error \\epsilon is assumed to follow a normal distribution, the risk score {\\bf x}^{\\top} {\\bf w} is also called the probit.\nIn practice, the logistic and probit models produce almost identical results. Logistic regression is far more common in machine learning, primarily because the sigmoid function and its derivative are computationally simpler and more efficient to work with.\n\n\n\nFrom now on, we’ll only look at the logistic model.

For example, it tells us that a student who studies for 3 hours has approximately a 60% chance of passing the exam. Crucially, for students who study many hours, the probability approaches 1 and then stays there. The model is no longer penalised for being “too correct,” which solves the main issue we had with linear regression.\nThis brings us to an important distinction. In linear regression, the model prediction, that we denote as h_{\\bf w}({\\bf x}), was a direct prediction of the outcome:\n\n  h_{\\bf w}({\\bf x}) = y\n\nIn logistic regression, the model prediction h_{\\bf w}({\\bf x}) is an estimate of the likelihood of the outcome:\n\n  h_{\\bf w}({\\bf x}) = p(y=1|{\\bf x},{\\bf w})\n\nThus, whereas in linear regression we try to answer the question:\nWhat is the expected value of y given {\\bf x}?\nIn logistic regression (and any other general linear model), we, instead, try to answer the question:\nWhat is the probability that y=1 given {\\bf x}?\nNote that this approach is now very robust to including students that have studied for many hours. In figure below we have added to the dataset a successful student that studied for 6.2 hours. The new logistic regression estimate (see next section) is almost identical to our previous estimate (both magenta and red curves actually coincide).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: The logistic model is robust; the new data point does not distort the fit (new fit is dotted magenta and is aligned with the original fit in solid red).",

We must find them using an iterative optimisation algorithm. The most common method is gradient descent.\nThe idea behind gradient descent is simple: we start with an initial guess for the weights, {\\bf w}^{(0)}, and then repeatedly take small steps in the direction that most steeply decreases the loss function. That direction is the negative of the gradient of the loss, -\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial  {\\bf w}}({\\bf w}).\nThe update rule for gradient descent is:\n\n{\\bf w}^{(t+1)} = {\\bf w}^{(t)} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial  {\\bf w}}({\\bf w}^{(t)})\n\nHere, \\eta is the learning rate, a hyperparameter that controls the size of each step.

For many years, other machine learning algorithms were the preferred methods for a wide range of tasks. In this chapter, we will briefly introduce some of the most influential classic supervised learning algorithms for classification. Given the scope of this chapter, we will only touch upon these techniques, as some would traditionally warrant dedicated modules for in-depth study.\nThe k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) algorithm is a simple yet powerful non-parametric method. To classify a new data point, {\\bf x}, the algorithm identifies the k closest data points in the training set (its “neighbours”). The new data point is then assigned to the class that is most common among its k neighbours. The confidence of the prediction can be expressed as the proportion of neighbours belonging to the majority class.\nFor example, in Figure 3.1, if we use k=3, the prediction for the new data point (with the question mark) would be the positive class (red cross) with 66% confidence. However, if we use k=5, the prediction would be the negative class (blue circle) with 60% confidence.\nFigure 3.2 shows the decision boundaries produced by k-NN for different values of k on three different datasets. The color shading indicates the predicted probability of belonging to each class. As you can see, the decision boundaries become smoother as k increases.\nPros:\nCons:",

This process is repeated until a leaf node is reached, which corresponds to a specific class label.\nWhile a single decision tree does not produce probabilistic predictions, ensemble methods like AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire 1995) and Random Forests (Ho 1995) combine the outputs of multiple decision trees to generate probabilities, similar to how we can get a confidence score with k-NN.\nAs shown in Figure 3.4, the decision boundaries of these models are composed of vertical and horizontal lines, aligned with the axes of the input space and corresponding to the tests performed (eg. x_2 &gt; 3, x_1 &gt; 2, etc. )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Decision boundaries for a single Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and Random Forest.

    "section": "3.5 The Kernel Trick",
    "text": "3.5 The Kernel Trick\nSVMs gained immense popularity with the introduction of the kernel trick.\n\n3.5.1 The Challenge of Feature Expansion\nRecall from our discussion of linear regression that we can fit non-linear relationships by augmenting the feature space with higher-order terms (e.g., x, x^2, x^3). This is a form of feature mapping, where we transform the original features into a higher-dimensional space: \\phi: {\\bf x}\\mapsto \\phi({\\bf x}). For example:\n\n\\phi ({x}) = \\left( \\begin{matrix} 1 \\\\ x \\\\ x^2 \\\\ x^3 \\\\ \\vdots\n\\end{matrix} \\right)\n\nFeature transformation is a fundamental concept in machine learning. The original features are often not sufficient to linearly separate the classes, and it is not always clear how to best transform them (see Figure 3.8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Feature mapping transforms the input data into a new space where a linear classifier can be used.\n\n\n\nA major challenge with feature expansion is that the dimensionality of the new feature space can grow very rapidly. For a polynomial expansion of degree d on an input feature vector of dimension p, the new feature vector will have a dimension of \\frac{(p+d)!}{p!\\, d!}.\nFor instance, with p=100 features and a polynomial of degree 5, the resulting feature vector would have a dimension of approximately 100 million. This makes computations, such as the least-squares solution {\\bf w} = (X^{\\top}X)^{-1}X^{\\top}{\\bf y}, completely impractical, as X^{\\top}X would be a 10^8 \\times 10^8 matrix.\nThe kernel trick provides an elegant solution to this problem, allowing us to work with very complex, high-dimensional feature mappings without ever explicitly computing them.\n\n\n3.5.2 Step 1: Re-parameterization\nIn many machine learning algorithms, the loss function depends on the score, which is calculated (see previous chapter) as {\\bf x}^{\\top}{\\bf w}. It can be shown (see Appendix D) that the optimal weight vector, \\hat{\\bf w}, can be expressed as a linear combination of the input feature vectors:\n\n\\hat{\\bf w} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i {\\bf x}_i,\n\nwhere the \\alpha_i are a new set of weights. These new weights are sometimes called the dual coefficients in SVM. The score can then be rewritten as:\n\n  {\\bf x}^{\\top}\\hat{\\bf w} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i {\\bf x}^{\\top} {\\bf x}_i,\n\nNotice that the score now depends on the dot products between feature vectors. This re-parameterization is key to the kernel trick. When we apply a feature mapping \\phi, the score becomes:\n\n    \\phi({\\bf x})^{\\top}{\\bf w} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\phi({\\bf x})^{\\top} \\phi({\\bf x}_i)\n\nTo compute the score in this high-dimensional space, we only need to be able to compute the dot products \\phi({\\bf x})^{\\top} \\phi({\\bf x}_i).\n\n\n3.5.3 Step 2: Kernel Functions\nWe define a kernel function as: \n\\kappa({\\bf u}, {\\bf v} ) = \\phi({\\bf u})^{\\top} \\phi({\\bf v}),\n\nThis allows us to rewrite the score as: \n\\phi({\\bf x})^{\\top}\\hat{\\bf w} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\kappa({\\bf x}, {\\bf x}_i).\n\nThe key here is that we can often define and compute the kernel function \\kappa without ever explicitly defining or computing the feature mapping \\phi. The theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) guarantees that for a wide class of kernel functions, a corresponding mapping \\phi does indeed exist.\nMany different kernel functions are available. For example, the polynomial kernel is defined as: \n\\kappa({\\bf u}, {\\bf v}) = (r - \\gamma {\\bf u}^{\\top} {\\bf v})^d\n This kernel is equivalent to the polynomial feature mapping of degree d we discussed earlier (see (Wikipedia 2025a)), but it avoids the computational explosion in dimensionality.\nThe most commonly used kernel is the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel (see (Wikipedia 2025b)): \n\\kappa({\\bf u}, {\\bf v}) = e^{- \\gamma \\| {\\bf u} - {\\bf\n      v}\\|^2 }\n\nThe feature mapping \\phi induced by the RBF kernel is infinitely dimensional, but we never need to compute it directly. A finite approximation of the mapping can be obtained by taking cosine/sine projections of the input feature onto a set of random directions {\\bf w}_{1}, \\ldots, {\\bf w}_{D}:\n\n\\varphi ({\\bf x})\\approx{\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {D}}}[\\cos ( {\\bf w}_{1}^\\top{\\bf x})\n,\\sin ( {\\bf w}_{1}^\\top{\\bf x})  ,\\ldots ,\\cos({\\bf w}_{D}^\\top{\\bf x})  ,\\sin({\\bf w}_{D}^\\top{\\bf x})\n]^{\\top}\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Understanding the RBF Kernel\nTo gain some intuition for how the RBF kernel works, let us consider the score for a particular data point {\\bf x}: \n\\mathrm{score}({\\bf x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\kappa({\\bf x}, {\\bf x}_i)\n\nThe kernel function \\kappa({\\bf u}, {\\bf v}) = e^{- \\gamma \\| {\\bf u} - {\\bf\nv}\\|^2 } acts as a measure of similarity between two data points. If {\\bf u} and {\\bf v} are close, \\kappa({\\bf u}, {\\bf v}) \\approx 1. If they are far apart, \\kappa({\\bf u}, {\\bf v}) \\approx 0. The parameter \\gamma controls the scale of this neighbourhood. As you can imaging, this is less intuitive for other kernels.\nIf we were to set \\alpha_i = 1 for positive examples and \\alpha_i = -1 for negative examples (which is a simplification of what SVM actually does), the score would be:\n\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    \\mathrm{score}({\\bf x}) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\kappa({\\bf x}, {\\bf x}_i)\n    \\\\\n    &\\approx \\sum_{i \\in \\text{neighbours of ${\\bf x}$}} \\begin{cases} 1 &\n      \\text{if $y_i$ positive} \\\\ -1 & \\text{if  $y_i$  negative}\n    \\end{cases} \\\\\n    &\\approx \\text{nb of positive neighbours of ${\\bf x}$}  - \\text{nb of negative\n      neighbours  of ${\\bf x}$}\n  \\end{aligned}\n\nThis is similar to k-NN. The score is high if a data point has more positive neighbours than negative neighbours. The main difference is that instead of a fixed number of neighbours (k), we consider all neighbours within a certain radius (controlled by \\gamma).\n\n\n3.5.5 Support Vectors\nIn an SVM, the optimal values of \\hat{\\alpha}_i are found by minimising the hinge loss. This is a constrained optimisation problem that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. The solution has the property that many of the \\alpha_i values are actually zero.\nThe data points for which \\alpha_i is non-zero are called support vectors. These are typically the points that lie closest to the decision boundary (see Figure 3.9). Only these support vectors are needed to make predictions, which can make the prediction process more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: An SVM with an RBF kernel. The support vectors are the data points with non-zero alpha values. Here they are highlighted with an outer circle, whose thickness is proportional to the magnitude of |\\alpha_i|.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10 shows the decision boundaries for SVMs with different polynomial kernels. As you can see, the decision boundaries are ellipses or hyperbolas. Examples of decision boundaries for the RBF kernel are shown in Figure 3.11. We can clearly see how the gamma parameter controls the smoothness of the boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Decision boundaries for SVMs with linear and polynomial kernels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Decision boundaries for SVMs with RBF kernels. The gamma parameter controls the smoothness of the boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.6 Remarks\n\nThe kernel trick is not limited to SVMs. Many other linear models, such as logistic regression, can be “kernelised.” These are known as kernel methods.\nA major drawback of kernel methods is that the computational cost of making predictions scales with the number of training examples (like with k-NN)\nThe training time for kernel methods can also be high for large datasets (e.g., tens of thousands of data points).\n\nEvidence that deep learning could outperform kernel SVMs on large datasets began to emerge in 2006. The real turning point came in 2012 with the success of AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) in the ImageNet competition.",

    "text": "4.1 Metrics for Binary Classification\nIn the preceding chapters, we have explored a variety of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN). We have seen how each of these models learns to draw a decision boundary to separate different classes in our feature space.\nLooking at these plots gives us a qualitative sense of how the classifiers behave, but it is not enough. To build effective machine learning systems, we need to move beyond visual intuition. We need a rigorous, quantitative way to answer critical questions:\nTo do this, we need to establish a set of standard, objective evaluation metrics that allow us to score and compare models in a consistent and meaningful way.\nLet us begin with the most common scenario: binary classification. Here, the outcome belongs to one of two classes, which we typically label as positive (class 1) and negative (class 0). For any prediction our classifier makes, there are four possible outcomes:\nThese four outcomes form the basis of nearly all binary classification metrics.",

(Predicts 0, and the true class is 0).\nFalse Positive (FP): The model incorrectly predicts the positive class. (Predicts 1, but the true class is 0). This is also known as a Type I error.\nFalse Negative (FN): The model incorrectly predicts the negative class. (Predicts 0, but the true class is 1). This is also known as a Type II error.\n\n\n\n4.1.1 The Confusion Matrix\nThe most fundamental tool for summarising a classifier’s performance is the confusion matrix. It is a simple table that lays out the counts of TP, TN, FP, and FN, providing a complete picture of the model’s predictions versus the actual ground truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActual: Negative (0)\nActual: Positive (1)\n\n\n\n\nPredicted: 0\nTN\nFN\n\n\nPredicted: 1\nFP\nTP\n\n\n\nThe structure of a confusion matrix.\n\n\nFor example, the confusion matrices for the classifiers shown in Figure 4.1 are as follows:\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Confusion Matrices for the classifiers shown in Figure 4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) RBF SVM classifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActual: 0\nActual: 1\n\n\n\n\nPredicted: 0\nTN=162\nFN=25\n\n\nPredicted: 1\nFP=17\nTP=196\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Decision Tree classifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActual: 0\nActual: 1\n\n\n\n\nPredicted: 0\nTN=170\nFN=17\n\n\nPredicted: 1\nFP=29\nTP=184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the confusion matrix is comprehensive, it is often useful to distill these counts into a few key summary statistics.\n\n\n4.1.2 Accuracy\nAccuracy is perhaps the most intuitive metric. It measures the overall fraction of predictions that the classifier got right.\n\n\\mathrm{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{TN}}{\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{TN} + \\mathrm{FP} + \\mathrm{FN}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\\text{Total number of predictions}}\n\nWhile simple, accuracy can be misleading, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets (where one class is much more frequent than the other). For example, if a disease affects only 1% of the population, a model that always predicts “no disease” will have 99% accuracy, but it will be completely useless for its intended purpose.\n\n\n4.1.3 Precision and Recall\nTo get a more nuanced view, we often turn to two complementary metrics: precision and recall.\nRecall, also known as Sensitivity or the True Positive Rate (TPR), answers the question: Of all the actual positive examples, what fraction did we correctly identify?\n\n\\mathrm{Recall} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{FN}} = p(\\hat{y}=1 | y=1)\n\nHigh recall is crucial in applications where failing to detect a positive case has severe consequences (e.g., medical screening, fraud detection). We want to minimise false negatives.\nPrecision answers the question: Of all the examples we predicted as positive, what fraction were actually positive?\n\n\\mathrm{Precision} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{FP}} = p(y=1 | \\hat{y}=1)\n\nHigh precision is important when the cost of a false positive is high (e.g., a spam filter marking an important email as spam).\nThere is often a trade-off between precision and recall. A model that is very aggressive in predicting positives will have high recall but may have low precision. A model that is very conservative will have high precision but may have low recall.\n\n\n4.1.4 The F1 Score\nThe F1 score provides a way to combine precision and recall into a single number. It is the harmonic mean of the two, which tends to be closer to the smaller of the two values. It is high only when both precision and recall are high.\n\nF_{1} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{Precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{Recall}}{\\mathrm{Precision} + \\mathrm{Recall}} = \\frac{2\\mathrm{TP}}{2\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{FP} + \\mathrm{FN}}\n\n\n\n4.1.5 The Importance of Using Multiple Metrics\nIt is critical to understand that a single metric rarely tells the whole story. Relying on just one can be dangerously misleading, as a classifier can easily be designed to perform perfectly on one metric while being terrible in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nConsider a dataset with 100 examples: 15 are positive (class 1) and 85 are negative (class 0).\n\nClassifier A always predicts positive (1). Its confusion matrix is: TN=0, FN=0, FP=85, TP=15. Its recall is 15/(15+0) = 100\\%, which sounds perfect! However, its precision is a dismal 15/(15+85) = 15\\%.\nClassifier B always predicts negative (0). Its confusion matrix is: TN=85, FN=15, FP=0, TP=0. Its accuracy is (85+0)/100 = 85\\%, which seems quite good. But its recall is 0/(0+15) = 0\\%. It fails to find any of the positive cases.\n\nBoth classifiers are useless, but you need at least two metrics (e.g., precision and recall, or recall and accuracy) to see the full picture.\nConclusion: Never evaluate a classifier with a single metric in isolation.",

    "text": "4.2 Visualising Performance: The ROC Curve\nMany classifiers, like logistic regression, do not output a hard 0 or 1 label directly. Instead, they produce a score or probability. We then apply a threshold to this score to make the final classification (e.g., predict 1 if score &gt; 0.5).\nChanging this threshold allows us to trade off between the True Positive Rate (Recall) and the False Positive Rate (FPR), which is the proportion of negatives that are incorrectly labelled as positive.\n\n\\mathrm{FPR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{FP}}{\\mathrm{FP} + \\mathrm{TN}} = p(\\hat{y}=1 | y=0)\n\nThe Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a powerful tool that visualises this trade-off. It is created by plotting the TPR (y-axis) against the FPR (x-axis) for every possible threshold value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: An example of Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for four different classifiers.\n\n\n\n\nA perfect classifier would achieve a TPR of 1 and an FPR of 0, corresponding to the top-left corner of the plot.\nA random classifier (e.g., flipping a coin) would produce a diagonal line from (0,0) to (1,1). Any useful classifier must perform above this line.\nThe closer the curve is to the top-left corner, the better the classifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: ROC curves for the classifiers from Figure 4.1.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Area Under the Curve (AUC)\nWhile the ROC curve provides a comprehensive view, it is often convenient to summarise it with a single number: the Area Under the Curve (AUC).\n\n\\mathrm{AUC} = \\int_0^1 \\mathrm{TPR}(\\mathrm{FPR}) \\, d\\mathrm{FPR}\n\nThe AUC can be interpreted as the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one. A perfect classifier has an AUC of 1.0, while a random classifier has an AUC of 0.5.\n\n\n4.2.2 Average Precision\nSimilarly, one can plot a Precision-Recall curve and compute the area under it, which is known as the Average Precision (AP). This metric is particularly informative for highly imbalanced datasets where the number of negatives far outweighs the number of positives.\nIt is implemented slightly differently from the ROC-AUC: \n\\mathrm{AP} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Precision}_i \\times \\left(\\mathrm{Recall}_i-\\mathrm{Recall}_{i-1}\\right)\n where \\mathrm{Recall}_i and \\mathrm{Precision}_i are the precision and recall values taken at n different thresholds T_i values.",

Then, we can average these per-class metrics.\n\nMacro-averaging: Compute the metric independently for each class and then take the unweighted average.

    "text": "4.4 The Three Essential Datasets: Training, Validation, and Testing\nNow that we have our metrics, we must be careful about what data we use to compute them. A robust evaluation workflow requires splitting our data into three distinct sets:\n\nTraining Set: This is the data the model learns from. The model’s parameters (e.g., the weights in logistic regression) are optimised to minimise the loss on this set.\nValidation (or Development) Set: This set is used to tune the model’s hyperparameters—the configuration settings that are not learned directly, such as the learning rate, the value of k in k-NN, or the strength of regularisation. We choose the hyperparameters that yield the best performance on the validation set.\nTest Set: This set is held out until the very end. It is used only once to provide a final, unbiased estimate of the chosen model’s performance on unseen data. You must never tune your model based on its performance on the test set. Doing so would be a form of data leakage, and your final performance metric would be an overly optimistic and invalid estimate of how the model will perform in the real world.\n\nThis separation is crucial to avoid overfitting. A model can easily memorise the training set, so good performance there means little. By tuning on a separate validation set, we get a more realistic estimate of generalisation. As tuning is essentially a form of training, performance on the dev set is also tainted. The final test set provides the ultimate, honest assessment.\nHow large do the dev/test sets need to be?\n\nTraining sets: as large as you can afford.\nValidation/Dev sets with sizes from 1,000 to 10,000 examples are common. With 100 examples, you will have a good chance of detecting an improvement of 5%. With 10,000 examples, you will have a good chance of detecting an improvement of 0.1%. The size of that dataset should be at least as large as what is required by your targetted confidence interval.\nTest sets should be large enough to give high confidence in the overall performance of your system. One popular heuristic had been to use 30% of your data for your test set. This is makes sense when you have, say, 100 to 10,000 examples but maybe less so when you have billion of training examples. Basically, think that you want to catch the all possible edge cases of your system.\n\nImportant: the test and dev sets should contain examples of what you ultimately want to perform well on, rather than whatever data you happen to have for training.",

    "text": "5.1.1 A Graph of Differentiable Operations\nTo understand why logistic regression can be viewed as a neural network, let us consider a simple case with two input features, x_1 and x_2. The prediction function can be visualised as a network of operations, as depicted in Figure 5.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Logistic Regression Model as a DAG\n\n\n\nThis type of model is known as a feed-forward neural network because it can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This graph describes how a set of differentiable operations are composed to form the overall function.\nEach node within this graph is referred to as a unit. The initial nodes, or the leaves of the graph, represent either the input values (e.g., x_1, x_2) or the model parameters (e.g., {w_0}, {w_1}, {w_2}). All subsequent units, such as u_1 and u_2, represent the outputs of functions that operate on the preceding units. In this example, u_1 is the output of a linear combination, u_1 = f_1(x_1,x_2,w_0,w_1,w_2)\n= w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2, and u_2 is the output of the sigmoid function, u_2=f_2(u_1) = 1/(1 + \\mathrm{exp}(-u_1)).\nWhile feed-forward neural networks are defined by their directed acyclic graph structure, it is worth noting that other types of neural networks exist. For example, Hopfield networks (Wikipedia 2025) are based on graphs that contain cycles, leading to recurrent connections. However, these will not be covered in this module. For our purposes, we will focus exclusively on feed-forward neural networks, which cover 99.9% of current research and applications.\n\n\n5.1.2 Units and Artificial Neurons\nThe term neural in “neural network” originates from the design of the network’s fundamental units, which are inspired by biological neurons.\nAn artificial neuron is a specific type of unit that performs a two-step computation. First, it calculates a weighted sum of its inputs (a linear combination). Second, it applies a non-linear function, known as an activation function, to this sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Neuron Model\n\n\n\nA variety of activation functions can be used. Some of the most popular are shown in Figure 5.3 and include the ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh Activation Functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Sigmoid, tanh, and Relu Activation Functions. Note that the Relu activation function (z\\mapsto \\max(0,z)) is not differentiable at z=0, but this is generally not a problem in practice.\n\n\n\nAlthough ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh are historically the most common activation functions, many others exist. In recent years, ReLU and its variants, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, ELU (Exponential Linear Unit), and Softplus, have become the preferred choice for many deep learning applications.\nIt is crucial to understand that the units in a network do not have to be neuron-like. As we will explore later, any differentiable function can serve as a unit. Historically, research focused on neuron-type units, which proved to be effective and versatile building blocks. Consequently, much of the literature is based on them. However, the modern definition of a neural network is more general: it is simply a DAG of differentiable functions. Modern deep learning frameworks reflect this by allowing developers to define custom units, provided that their gradients can be computed.",

    "section": "5.2 Biological Neurons",
    "text": "5.2 Biological Neurons\nThe original concept of artificial neurons was an attempt to create a simplified mathematical model of their biological counterparts. In a biological neuron, signals received by the dendrites are aggregated. This combined signal must then reach a certain threshold to trigger an output spike, a process that bears a resemblance to the behaviour of a ReLU activation function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Representation of a Biological Neuron\n\n\n\nNumerous mathematical models have been proposed to capture the complex electrical dynamics of a neuron. One of the most well-known is the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. It describes the relationship between the input current, I(t), and the change in the neuron’s membrane voltage, V_m(t), over time:\n\nC_{\\mathrm {m} }{\\frac {dV_{\\mathrm {m} }(t)}{dt}}=I(t)-{\\frac {V_{\\mathrm {m} }(t)}{R_{\\mathrm {m} }}}\n\nIn the LIF model, the membrane voltage increases as the neuron receives input current from connected neurons. If the voltage reaches a specific threshold, the neuron “fires,” producing an output voltage spike. Immediately after firing, the membrane potential is reset to a lower resting value. Models that exhibit this behaviour are known as spiking neuron models. Figure 5.5 provides a schematic of the LIF model as an electrical circuit (left) and illustrates how the membrane potential responds to a constant input current (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: The leaky Integrate-and-Fire model. On the left, a circuit representing the neuron. On the right, an illustration of the neuron membrane voltage response under a constant input intensity. The voltage builds up, up to a v_{th} threshold, at which point the neuron will output a spike and reset its membrane potential.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6 illustrates the dynamics of a network of spiking neurons. Each neuron in the network receives sequences of voltage spikes from its connected peers. It integrates these incoming signals, causing its own membrane potential to rise. Once its potential reaches the firing threshold, it emits its own spike, which is then transmitted to other neurons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Overview of the spiking neuron models.\n\n\n\nA key feature of the LIF model is the “leaky” nature of the membrane: in the absence of sufficient input stimuli, the membrane potential gradually decays back to its resting state. This implies that the input signal must have a certain minimum intensity to make the neuron fire. For example, in Figure 5.6, the spikes arriving after time t_1 are not frequent or strong enough to trigger an output.\nFigure 5.7 shows the neuron’s output firing rate as a function of a constant input intensity, for different levels of noise. This plot clearly shows two operational regimes: below a certain input threshold, the firing rate is close to zero; above the threshold, the rate increases approximately linearly with the input intensity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Output Fire rate as a function of the input intensity for different levels of noise (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03609).\n\n\n\nThis thresholding behaviour is precisely what artificial activation functions aim to capture. The response curves in Figure 5.7 are strikingly similar in shape to common activation functions like ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Softplus. The figure also reveals that the precise shape of this response curve is influenced by the characteristics of the input signal, such as its noise level.\nThis highlights a functional equivalence between the abstract models used in deep learning and the dynamics of biological spiking neurons. It is possible to convert a conventional Deep Neural Network (DNN) into an equivalent Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This is an active area of research, driven by the potential for SNNs to be implemented in highly energy-efficient hardware.\nThe main takeaway is that the artificial neurons used in DNNs are reasonable functional approximations of their biological counterparts. However, it is important to remember that this biological connection is primarily an inspiration. For the purposes of this module, it is most productive to view DNNs from a mathematical perspective: as graphs of differentiable operations that allow you to build complex, learnable functions.",

In a layered architecture, the outputs of all units in one layer typically serve as the inputs for the subsequent layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Deep Neural Network or neuron units in a Multi-Layer Perceptron Layout.

When every unit in a layer is connected to every unit in the preceding layer, it is known as a Dense Layer or a Fully Connected Layer (FCL), and also referred to as a Linear Layer in PyTorch (torch.nn.Linear). This is a common but not the only type of layer. In the next chapter, we will introduce another important type: the convolutional layer.\nA network with two or more hidden layers, such as the one in Figure 5.9, is classified as a deep feed-forward neural network. The exact point at which a network becomes “deep” is not universally agreed upon. However, the distinction is historically significant because, before the development of the backpropagation algorithm (which we will discuss shortly), there was no effective method for training networks with more than one hidden layer.",

    "text": "5.4 Universal Approximation Theorem\nThe Universal Approximation Theorem (Hornik, 1991) is a foundational result in the theory of neural networks. It states that:\n\nA neural network with just one hidden layer and a linear output unit can approximate any continuous function to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, provided the hidden layer has a sufficient number of units.\n\nThis powerful result holds for a wide range of activation functions, including sigmoid and tanh. For an intuitive explanation of why this theorem holds, please refer to Appendix B.\nThe theorem provides a powerful guarantee: neural networks are, in principle, capable of modelling almost any continuous relationship in data. It suggests that we can always improve the model’s accuracy by simply adding more hidden units.\nHowever, while the theorem guarantees that a single hidden layer is sufficient, modern practice has shown that deeper networks (with multiple hidden layers) are often far more efficient. They can typically achieve the same or better performance with significantly fewer total parameters and often generalise better to unseen data.\nTherefore, rather than simply increasing the number of units in a single layer (a “wide” network), it is often more effective to carefully design the network’s architecture. This involves deciding on the number of layers (the “depth”), the number of units in each layer, and how these units are interconnected.\nThis field of network design, known as neural architecture search, is a major area of contemporary research. We know that neural networks are universal approximators; the central challenge now is to design architectures that are not only powerful but also efficient to train and that generalise well to new, unseen data.",

This mapping is determined by a set of learnable parameters, or weights, {\\bf w} = (w_1, \\dots, w_q):\n\nf(x_1, \\cdots, x_p, w_1, \\cdots, w_q) = (y_1,\\cdots, y_r)\n\nFigure 5.11 shows an example of a computation graph for evaluating such a model. To illustrate the generality of this framework, the units in this graph are not restricted to be standard neurons but can be arbitrary differentiable functions. For example, one could define u_7 as u_7: (u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4) \\mapsto\n\\cos(u_1+u_2+u_3)\\exp(-2u_4) and u_8 as u_8: (u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4) \\mapsto\n\\sin(u_1+u_2+u_3)\\exp(-3u_4).\nTo emphasise the uniformity of the graph representation, all values in this example—inputs, weights, and intermediate outputs—are denoted by u_j, where j is the unit’s index. In this specific graph, an input feature vector {\\bf x}_i=[u_1,u_2,u_3]^{\\top} is processed using weights {\\bf\nw}=[u_4,u_5]^{\\top} to produce the output vector f({\\bf x}_i, {\\bf\nw})=[u_{12},u_{13},u_{14}].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Example of a graph of operations for neural net evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe goal of training is to find the optimal set of weights {\\bf w} that makes the network’s predictions accurate. This is achieved by first evaluating the network’s output f({\\bf x}_i, {\\bf w}) for a given input {\\bf x}_i from the training data. This prediction is then compared to the true, observed result {\\bf y}_i using a loss function, E, which quantifies the error.\nTypically, the total loss is aggregated over the entire dataset of n observations: \nE({\\bf w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n e(f({\\bf x}_i, {\\bf w}), {\\bf y}_i),\n where e(\\cdot, \\cdot) is the loss function for a single observation.\nThe computation graph for training on a single observation can now be constructed, as shown in Figure 5.12. This graph is an extension of the evaluation graph, with the network’s output units now connected to a final unit that computes the loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Example of a graph of operations for neural net training.\n\n\n\nTo be precise, Figure 5.12 depicts the computation for a single observation. The graph for the entire training process would involve replicating this structure for all observations and aggregating their individual losses to compute the total loss, E.\nTo find the optimal weights {\\bf w}, we use an iterative optimisation algorithm, most commonly gradient descent. Starting from a random initial set of weights {\\bf w}^{(0)}, the algorithm repeatedly updates them in the direction that minimises the loss:\n\n{\\bf w}^{(m+1)} = {\\bf w}^{(m)} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {\\bf\nw}}({\\bf w}^{(m)})\n Here, \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {\\bf w}} is the gradient of the total loss with respect to the weights.

The scalar \\eta is a hyperparameter called the learning rate, which controls the size of the step we take in the opposite direction of the gradient. Choosing an appropriate learning rate is crucial for successful training.\nTherefore, any neural network can be trained using gradient descent, provided we have an efficient method for computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to every weight in the network, \\frac{\\partial\ne}{\\partial {\\bf w}}.

    "section": "5.7 Backpropagation",
    "text": "5.7 Backpropagation\nThe backpropagation algorithm, often shortened to “backprop”, was popularised in a seminal 1986 paper by David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams. It provides an efficient way to compute the gradients required for training.\n\nRumelhart, David E., Geoffrey E. Hinton, and Ronald J. Williams. “Learning representations by back-propagating errors.” Cognitive Modeling 5.3 (1988): 1.\n\n\n5.7.1 Computing the Gradient\nWhy do we need a special algorithm for computing the gradient? A naive approach would be to compute the partial derivative with respect to each weight w_{i} individually using numerical differentiation (the finite difference method): \n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w_{i}} \\approx \\frac{e(\\cdots, w_{i}+\\varepsilon, \\cdots) - e(\\cdots, w_{i}, \\cdots)}{\\varepsilon}\n where \\varepsilon is a very small number. While this method is simple to implement, its computational cost makes it impractical for neural networks.\nA modern deep neural network can easily have hundreds of millions of parameters. To compute the full gradient using this numerical approach, we would need to evaluate the entire network once for each parameter. For a network with 100 million parameters, this would mean 100 million forward passes through the network just to perform a single weight update. Clearly, this is computationally infeasible.\nIn contrast, backpropagation can compute the exact gradient for all parameters simultaneously in approximately the time it takes to perform just two forward passes. The efficiency of backpropagation is what transformed neural networks from a theoretical curiosity into a practical and powerful machine learning technique.\nThe process of computing the output of a network for a given input is called forward propagation (or a forward pass). Information flows from the input layer, through the hidden units, to the output layer. During training, the forward pass extends all the way to the final loss unit, producing a scalar error value e({\\bf w}).\nThe backpropagation algorithm then begins. It uses the chain rule from calculus to efficiently propagate gradient information backwards, starting from the final loss unit and moving all the way back to the network’s weights.\n\n\n5.7.2 The Chain Rule\nLet us briefly recall the chain rule. For a simple composition of functions, such as z = f(y) where y = g(x), the derivative of z with respect to x is found by multiplying the derivatives of the constituent functions: \n\\frac{dz}{dx} = \\frac{dz}{dy}\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(y)g'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)\n\nFor multivariate functions, the chain rule is slightly more complex. Suppose z is a function of several variables, z=f(u_1, \\dots, u_n), where each u_k is itself a function of x, u_k=g_k(x). The derivative of z with respect to x is then the sum of the contributions from each path:\n\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u_k} \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x}\n\n\nExample 5.1 (Chain-Rule) Assume that u(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, y(r, t) = r \\sin(t) and x(r,t) = r\n\\cos(t), then we can compute {\\frac  {\\partial u}{\\partial r}} as follows:\n\n\\begin{split}\n{\\frac  {\\partial u}{\\partial r}} &={\\frac  {\\partial u}{\\partial x}}{\\frac  {\\partial x}{\\partial r}}+{\\frac  {\\partial u}{\\partial y}}{\\frac  {\\partial y}{\\partial r}} \\\\ &=(2x)(\\cos(t))+(2y)(\\sin(t)) \\\\ &=2r(\\sin ^{2}(t)+\\cos^2(t))\\\\&= 2r\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.1}\n\n\n\n5.7.3 Back-Propagating with the Chain-Rule\nLet us now apply the chain rule to our neural network example to see how backpropagation works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: Backpropagation starts with all the nodes that are directely required to compute the loss function. In this case: u_{12}, u_{13}, u_{14}.\n\n\n\nThe process starts after a full forward pass has been completed, meaning all unit values, including the final loss e, have been computed. The first step of backpropagation is to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the inputs of the loss function unit. In our example, these are \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{12}}, \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{13}}, and \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{14}}. Since e is a direct function of u_{12}, u_{13}, u_{14}, these initial gradients are straightforward to compute.\nFor instance, if the loss function is the squared error \ne(u_{12},u_{13},u_{14}) = (u_{12}-a)^2 + (u_{13}-b)^2 + (u_{14}-c)^2,\n then the partial derivatives are simply: \n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{12}} = 2(u_{12} - a) \\quad, \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{13}} = 2(u_{13} - b)\n\\quad, \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{14}} = 2(u_{14} - c).\n\nNow that we have the gradients “at the end” of the network, we can work backwards. For instance, how can we compute the gradient with respect to an earlier unit, such as \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{10}}?\nWe use the chain rule as in Equation 5.1. In our graph, unit u_{10} is an input to units u_{12}, u_{13}, and u_{14}. Therefore, its gradient is: \n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{10}} =\n\\frac{\\partial u_{12}}{\\partial u_{10}} \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{12}} +\n\\frac{\\partial u_{13}}{\\partial u_{10}} \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{13}} +\n\\frac{\\partial u_{14}}{\\partial u_{10}} \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_{14}}\n\nThe term \\frac{\\partial u_{14}}{\\partial u_{10}} is the local gradient of the unit u_{14} with respect to its input u_{10}. If, for example, the function for u_{14} was a linear combination u_{14} = u_5 + 0.2\nu_{10} + \\dots, then this local gradient would simply be 0.2.\nBy repeatedly applying this process, we can propagate the gradients backwards through the network, computing the gradient for each node one layer at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\n\n\nBackpropagation can be viewed as a form of dynamic programming. It proceeds by induction. Assume we have already computed the gradient \\frac{\\partial\ne}{\\partial u_j} for all units u_j in a set \\mathcal{K}. We can then compute the gradient for any node u_i whose outputs are all in \\mathcal{K} by applying the chain rule:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_i} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathrm{Outputs}(i) } \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_j} \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial u_i}\n\\end{equation}\nThe gradient of the loss e with respect to an arbitrary unit u_i is thus the sum of the gradients flowing back from all the units that u_i is an input to.\nSince the values of \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial u_j} (the “upstream” gradients) are already known, we only need to compute the “local” gradients, \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial u_i}, which involves differentiating the function for unit u_j with respect to its input u_i. This backward pass continues until the gradients have been computed for all the parameters (weights) of the network.\n\n\nBackpropagation is a remarkably efficient algorithm for computing the gradient of a scalar-valued function with respect to all inputs of a computation graph. The computational complexity of backpropagation is proportional to the number of operations in the forward pass. For most common network architectures, this is a linear function of the number of units, making it extremely scalable. It is this efficiency that makes training deep neural networks with millions of parameters computationally feasible.\n\n\n5.7.4 Vanishing Gradients\nDespite the efficiency of backpropagation, a significant challenge arises when training very deep networks: the vanishing gradient problem.\n\nHochreiter, S. (1991). Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen Netzen (PDF) (diploma thesis). Technical University Munich, Institute of Computer Science.\n\nConsider a deep network with many layers, for instance, the 6-layer network shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.14: Backpropagation.\n\n\n\nTo compute the gradient of the loss with respect to an early weight w, the chain rule involves a long product of derivatives from each subsequent layer: \n\\frac{de}{dw} = \\frac{de}{du_6}\\frac{du_6}{du_5}\\frac{du_5}{du_4}\\frac{du_4}{du_3}\\frac{du_3}{du_2}\\frac{du_2}{du_1}\\frac{du_1}{dw}\n If any of the terms in this product are small (i.e., less than 1), the overall product will shrink exponentially as it is propagated backwards. This can cause the gradient to become extremely small, or “vanish,” by the time it reaches the early layers of the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.15: Derivatives of common activation functions.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 5.15, the derivatives for the sigmoid and tanh functions are close to zero for most of their input range. When a neuron’s input falls into this “saturated” region, its local gradient will be close to zero. During backpropagation, this small gradient will be multiplied with others, increasing the risk of the overall gradient vanishing. When the gradient \\frac{de}{dw} becomes close to zero, the weight updates become negligible, and the network effectively stops learning.\nThe vanishing gradient problem is a fundamental obstacle in training deep networks. It is one of the primary reasons that the ReLU activation function has become popular. Since the derivative of ReLU is 1 for all positive inputs, it is less prone to causing gradients to shrink. Many modern network architectures, such as Residual Networks (ResNets) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), incorporate specific mechanisms designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.",

    "text": "5.8 Optimisations for Training Deep Neural Networks\nWe have established that network weights can be trained using gradient descent, with the gradients being computed efficiently by the backpropagation algorithm. However, a major challenge remains: the resulting objective functions to be optimised are highly complex and non-convex. Standard gradient descent is not guaranteed to find a global minimum; it can get stuck in poor local minima or saddle points.\nConsequently, tuning the training process is a critical part of developing any neural network application. There is no single “best” set of hyperparameters; finding a good combination often requires experimentation and a degree of trial and error. Fortunately, a range of optimisation strategies and regularisation techniques have been developed to improve the speed and stability of the training process.\n\n5.8.1 Mini-Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent\nRecall that the total loss is typically the average of the individual losses over all n observations in the training set:\n\n  E({\\bf w}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n e(f({\\bf x}_i, {\\bf w}), {\\bf y}_i)\n\nTo compute the true gradient of the total loss E, we must average the individual gradients over the entire dataset. This approach becomes computationally expensive and slow when the dataset is large, as it requires processing every single sample before making one update to the weights.\nA more practical and widely used approach is mini-batch gradient descent. Instead of the entire dataset, the gradient is estimated using a small, random subset of the data called a mini-batch. For example, with a batch size of 16, the gradient is approximated using the average over just 16 samples. The weights are updated, and then the gradient is computed for the next mini-batch.\nIn the extreme case where the batch size is 1, the gradient is estimated based on a single sample at a time. This method is known as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (see torch.optim.SGD in PyTorch).\nSmaller batch sizes allow for more frequent weight updates, which can speed up convergence. The gradient estimate is also “noisier” because it is based on fewer samples. This noise can be beneficial, as it can help the optimiser escape from sharp, poor local minima. However, it can also make the convergence path erratic and prevent the optimiser from settling into a good minimum.\nAn epoch is defined as one full pass through the entire training dataset. For a dataset of size n and a batch size of B, one epoch consists of n/B gradient descent steps (or iterations). It is standard practice to shuffle the training data at the beginning of every epoch to ensure that the mini-batches are different each time, preventing cyclical behaviour and improving convergence.\n\n\n5.8.2 More Advanced Gradient Descent Optimizers\nVanilla gradient descent can be inefficient in certain common scenarios. For example, as illustrated in Figure 5.16, if the loss function landscape contains long, narrow ravines, the optimiser may oscillate back and forth across the steep walls of the ravine while making only slow progress along the bottom towards the minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.16: Illustration of a Stochastic Gradient Descent converging poorly.\n\n\n\nAs illustrated in the figure, the direction of steepest descent (the negative gradient) does not always point directly towards the minimum, leading to an inefficient, zig-zagging path.\nOne common technique to improve convergence is to use a learning rate schedule, where the learning rate \\eta is gradually decreased over the course of training. This allows for larger steps at the beginning and smaller, more precise steps as the optimiser approaches a minimum.\nAnother powerful approach is to incorporate momentum. This technique helps to accelerate progress along shallow gradients and dampen oscillations. It achieves this by adding a fraction of the previous update vector to the current one, creating an exponentially weighted moving average of the gradients: \\begin{align*}\n    {\\bf v}^{(m+1)} &= \\mu {\\bf v}^{(m)} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial {\\bf\nw}}({\\bf w}^{(m)}) \\\\\n    {\\bf w}^{(m+1)} &= {\\bf w}^{(m)} + {\\bf v}^{(m+1)}\n  \\end{align*} with \\mu\\approx 0.9 controlling the moving average.\nMany other, more sophisticated optimisation algorithms have been developed, each with its own strategy for adapting the learning rate or update rule. Popular examples include Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adam.\nAdam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) and its variant Nadam are currently among the most widely used and effective optimisers, often providing good results with little hyperparameter tuning. However, the best choice of optimiser is problem-dependent, so it is always good practice to experiment with a few different ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nhttp://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/\nPyTorch optimisers",

A simple way to do this is to create new training examples by adding a small amount of random noise (e.g., from a Gaussian distribution) to the input features of the original samples.\nThis idea can be taken a step further by injecting noise not just at the input layer, but also to the activations of the hidden units during the training process.\n\n\n\n\nA very effective and widely used regularisation technique that builds on this idea is dropout. During each training step, dropout randomly sets the output of a fraction of the units in a layer to zero. This is equivalent to training a large ensemble of smaller networks that share weights, which prevents complex co-adaptations between neurons and forces the network to learn more robust features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nPyTorch docs for Dropout",

    "text": "5.11 Monitoring and Training Diagnostics\nTraining a deep neural network can be a lengthy process, taking anywhere from hours to several days or even weeks. It is therefore essential to carefully monitor the process to ensure it is proceeding correctly. Tracking metrics like the loss function over time is crucial for diagnosing potential problems.\nAs we saw with simpler models, the training loss curve can reveal a lot about the learning process. A rapidly fluctuating or increasing loss suggests that the learning rate is too high, causing the optimiser to overshoot minima or even diverge. Conversely, a very slowly decreasing loss indicates that the learning rate is too low, and the training will be impractically slow (see Figure 5.17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.17: Possible effects of the Learning Rate on the training.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, it is vital to monitor performance on a separate validation set. A significant gap between the training performance and the validation performance is a clear indicator of overfitting: the model has learned the training data too well, including its noise, and has failed to generalise to new, unseen data. Figure 5.18 illustrates this phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.18: Detecting Overfitting in Training.",

A key research challenge is designing network architectures that are both powerful and trainable, overcoming issues like the vanishing gradient problem.\nThe network’s weights are trained using gradient-based optimisation, where the computationally expensive gradient calculation is made feasible by the efficient backpropagation algorithm.\nTraining is a complex process. The non-convex nature of the resulting loss functions means that convergence to a good solution is not guaranteed. Careful monitoring, along with the use of advanced optimisation and regularisation techniques, is essential.

    "text": "A Smarter Way to Process Grid-Type Tensors\nRecall that in dense layers, as in Figure 6.1, every unit in the layer is connected to every unit in the adjacent layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Deep Neural Network in a Multi-Layer Perceptron Layout.\n\n\n\nWhen the input is an image (as in the MNIST dataset), each pixel in the input image corresponds to a unit in the input layer. For an input image of dimension width by height pixels and 3 colour channels, the input layer will be a multidimensional array, or tensor, containing (3 \\times {\\tt height}\\times\n{\\tt width}) input units.\nIf the next layer is of the same size, then there are up to (3 \\times\n{\\tt height}\\times {\\tt width})^2 weights to train, which can become very large very quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Dense Layer on Images.\n\n\n\nWith a fully connected layer, the spatial structure of the image tensor is not taken advantage of.\nIt is known, for instance, that pixel values are usually more related to their neighbours than to far away locations. This needs to be taken advantage of.\nThis is what is done in convolutional neural networks, where the units in the next layer are only connected to their neighbours in the input layer. In this case the neighbourhood is defined as a 5\\times\n5 window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Convolution only involves local relationship within some neighbourhood (here a 5 \\times 5 neighbourhood).\n\n\n\nMoreover, the weights are shared across all the pixels. That is, the weights in convnets are associated to the relative positions of the neighbours and shared across all pixel locations.\nLet us see how they are defined. Denote the units of a layer as u_{i,j,k,n}, where n refers to the layer, i,j to the coordinates of the pixel and k to the channel of consideration.\nThe logit for that neuron is defined as the result of a convolution filter:\n\n\\mathrm{logit}_{i, j, k, n} = w_{0,k,n} + \\sum_{a=-h_1}^{h_1}\\sum_{b=-h_2}^{h_2}\\sum_{c=1}^{h_3} w_{a,b,c,k,n} u_{a+i,b+j,c,n-1}\n\nwhere h_1 and h_2 correspond to half of the dimensions of the neighbourhood window and h_3 is the number of channels of the input image for that layer. (Some may have noted that this is in fact not the formula for convolution but instead the formula for cross-correlation. Since convolution is just a cross-correlation with a mirrored mask, most neural networks platforms simply implement the cross-correlation so as to avoid the extra mirroring step. Both formulas are totally equivalent in practice).\nAfter activation f, the output of the neuron is simply:\n\nu_{i, j, k, n} =\nf\\left( \\mathrm{logit}_{i,j,k,n} \\right)\n\nConsider the case of a grayscale image (1 channel) where the convolution is defined as:\n\n\\mathrm{logit}_{i, j, n} = u_{i+1,j,n-1} + u_{i-1,j,n-1} + u_{i,j+1,n-1} +\nu_{i,j-1,n-1} - 4 u_{i,j,n-1}\n\nThe weights can be arranged as a weight mask (also called kernel) that is applied at each pixel location (see Figure 6.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: The convolution kernel defines the relationships between a point on the grid and all of its neighbours. These weights are defined the same way for all locations on the grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nSignal Processing Connections\nNote that convolution is a fundamental consequence of working on grid-type data. Indeed, as may have already been seen in a signal processing module, convolution naturally arises when trying to design operations on signals that follow the constraints of linearity and shift-invariance.\nAn operator with input x and output y is linear if a x(i,j) + b x(i,j) \\rightarrow a y(i,j) + b\ny(i,j). Linearity is something already present with the neurons thanks to the linear combination of the inputs. Shift invariance (or time-invariance for time series) means that x(i-a, j-b) \\rightarrow y(i-a, j-b), which is also a very reasonable assumption. One would expect indeed that shifting the input tensor to the left has the only effect of shifting the output tensor to the left.\nIf a system is both linear and sift-invariant, then it can be expressed directly using convolution: y = x * h, where h is the system’s impulse response defined by the kernel mask. This makes convolution ineluctable in neural networks that have this kind of grid structure.\nNote also that the examples given here are for 2D images, but it is also possible to do convolution for 1D data (eg. time series or text processing), and ND data (eg. fluid simulation, 3D reconstruction, etc.).\n\n\nExample\nNext is a colour picture with a tensor of size 3 \\times 592 \\times 443 (width=443, height=592, number of channels=3). The convolutional layer used has a kernel of size 5\\times 5, and produces 6 different filters. The padding strategy is set to valid thus 2 pixels are lost on each side. The output tensor of the convolutional layer is a picture of size 6 \\times 588 \\times 439.\nIn PyTorch, the equivalent code would be:\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nx = torch.randn(1, 3, 592, 443)\nconv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, in_channels=6, kernel_size=5)\nx = nn.functional.relu(conv(x))\nprint(x.shape) # returns torch.Size([1, 6, 588, 439])\nNote that PyTorch uses uses the channel-first convention (also known as NCHW) and in this lecture notes, I will try to stick to this notation system too. NCHW is a common data format for image data, where N represents the batch size, C the number of channels, H the image height, and W the image width. This order specifies that the channels dimension is followed by the height and width. This typically results in a better memory layout for convolution operations on he GPU.\nThis convolution layer is defined by 3 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 450 weights (to which one needs to add the 6 biases, with 1 for each filter, so 456 parameters in total). This is only a fraction of what would be required in a dense layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconv1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconv2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconv3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconv4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Example of convolution outputs",

The convolutional layers are laid out in sequence. After block1_pool, the image tensor contains 64 channels but is halved in width and height. As the process goes deeper, the width and height is further halved and the number of channels/features increase. At block5_pool, the tensor width and height is 32 times smaller than the original but the number of channels/features per pixel is 512.\nThe last dense layers (FC1, FC2) perform the classification task based on the visual features of block5_pool.\nLet us take the following input image (tensor size 3 \\times 224 \\times 224, image has been resized to match that dimension):\n\n\n\noriginal image\n\n\nBelow are shown the output of some of the layers of this network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: A few output images from the 64 filters of block1_conv2 (size 64 \\times 224 \\times 224)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: A few output images from the 128 filters of block2_conv2 (size $112 $)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: A few output images from the 256 filters of block3_conv3 (size 56 \\times 56)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: A few output images from the 512 filters of block4_conv3 (size 28 \\times 28)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.16: A few output images from the 512 filters of block5_conv3 (size 14 \\times 14)\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the output of the filters become more and more sparse, that is, for the last layer, most of entries are filled with zeros and only a few features show a high response. This is promising as it helps classification if there is a clear separation between each of the features. In this case, the third filter in the last row seem to pick up the bird’s head and eyes.",

    "text": "6.7 Visualisation\nUnderstanding each of the inner operations of a trained network is still an open problem. Thankfully Convolutional Neural Nets focus on images and a few visualisation techniques have been proposed.\n\n6.7.1 Retrieving images that maximise a neuron activation\nThe simplest technique is perhaps to take an entire dataset and retrieve the images that have maximum response for the particular filter of interest. Recall that the output of ReLU and sigmoid is always positive and that a positive activation means that the filter has detected something. Thus finding the image that maximises the response from that filter will give a good indication about the nature of that filter.\nBelow is an example shown in Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation by Ross Girshick et al.:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.17: Images that maximise the output of 6 filters of AlexNet. The activation values and the receptive field of the particular neuron are shown in white. [Ross Girshick et al.]\n\n\n\nA subtle point that must be kept in mind is that convolution layers produce a basis of filters, that are linearly combined afterwards. This means that each filter is not necessarily semantic by itself, it is better to think of them as basis functions. This means that these exemplars are not necessarily semantically meaningful in isolation. Instead, they typically show different types of textural patterns. This is perhaps more evident when looking at the other possible visualisation technique presented below.\n\n\n6.7.2 Engineering Examplars\nAnother visualisation technique is to engineer an input image that maximises the activation for a specific filter (see this paper by Simonyan et al. and this Keras blog post).\nThe optimisation proceeds as follows:\n\nDefine the loss function as the mean value of the activation for that filter.\nUse backpropagation to compute the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. the input image.\nUpdate the input image using a gradient ascent approach, so as to maximise the loss function. Go back to 2.\n\nA few examples of optimised input images for VGG16 are presented below (see here):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.20\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the visual features picked up by the first layers are very low-level (eg. edges, corners), but as the process goes deeper, the features pick up much more complex texture patterns.\nA classifier would linearly combine the responses to these filters to produce the logits for each class.",

    "text": "7.1.1 Re-Using Pre-Trained Networks\nTransfer learning is a powerful technique that involves reusing knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on a related but different task.\nImagine you are tasked with developing a deep learning application to recognise pelicans in images. Training a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch would require a massive dataset, potentially hundreds of thousands of images, and weeks of training time. If you only have access to a few thousand images, this approach is impractical.\nThis is where transfer learning offers a solution. Instead of starting from scratch, you can leverage existing, pre-trained networks. Consider the architecture of AlexNet, as shown in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: AlexNet Architecture (2012).\n\n\n\nIn broad terms, the convolutional layers (up to C5) are responsible for learning and extracting visual features from the input images. The final dense layers (FC6, FC7, and FC8) then use these features to perform classification.\nNetworks like AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet have been trained on vast datasets such as ImageNet, which contains millions of images across thousands of categories. As a result, the filters learned by their convolutional layers are highly generic and effective for a wide range of visual tasks. These features can be repurposed for your specific application.\nInstead of training a new network to learn visual features, you can reuse the ones from a pre-trained model. The process involves taking a pre-trained network, removing its final classification layers, and replacing them with your own, specialised layers designed for your specific task.\nDepending on the size of your training dataset, you might choose to redesign only the final layer (e.g., FC8) or several of the later layers (e.g., C5, FC6, FC7, FC8). Redesigning more layers requires a larger amount of training data.\nIf you have a sufficient number of training samples, you can also fine-tune the imported layers by allowing backpropagation to update their weights. This adapts the pre-trained features to better suit your specific application. If your dataset is small, it is generally better to freeze the weights of the imported layers to prevent overfitting.\nIn PyTorch, you can freeze the weights of a layer by instructing PyTorch not to update the weights during backprobagation. For instance, the following code freezes the all the weights in layer3 of model:\n# Freeze weights in layer named `layer3`\nfor name, layer in model.named_children():\n    if name in ['layer3']:\n        for param in layer.parameters():\n            param.requires_grad = False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most image-based applications, it is highly recommended to start by reusing an off-the-shelf network. Research has shown that these generic visual features provide a strong baseline and can achieve state-of-the-art performance in many applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nRazavian et al. ``CNN Features off-the-shelf: an Astounding Baseline for Recognition’’. 2014. https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6382\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Domain Adaptation and Vanishing Gradients\nReusing networks on new datasets can present challenges. Consider a single neuron with a \\mathrm{tanh} activation function, f(x_i, w) = \\mathrm{tanh}(x_i+w). Suppose the original network was trained on images taken on sunny days. The input values, x_i (red dots in Figure 7.2), are centred around 0, and the learned weight is \\hat{w}=0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Domain Shift Example.\n\n\n\nNow, we want to fine-tune this network with new images taken on cloudy days. The input values for these new samples, x_i (green crosses), are now centred around 5. In this input range, the derivative of the \\mathrm{tanh} function is close to zero, leading to the problem of vanishing gradients. This makes it extremely difficult to update the network weights effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Normalisation Layers\nTo address this, it is crucial to ensure that the input data is within an appropriate value range. Normalisation Layers are used to scale the data according to the statistics of the training set, mitigating the effects of domain shift.\nThe output x_i' of a normalisation layer is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx'_{i} = \\frac{x_{i} - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}\n\nwhere \\mu_i and \\sigma_i are the mean and standard deviation of the input data, computed offline.\n\n\nAfter normalisation, the new samples are centred around 0, as shown in Figure 7.3, placing them in a region where the gradient of the activation function is large enough for effective learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Domain Shift after Normalisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Batch Normalisation\nBatch Normalisation (BN) is a specific type of normalisation layer where the scaling parameters, \\mu and \\sigma, are determined as follows:\n\nDuring training, \\mu_i and \\sigma_i are the mean and standard deviation of the input x_i over the current mini-batch. This ensures that the output x_i' has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.\nDuring evaluation, \\mu_i and \\sigma_i are the mean and standard deviation computed over the entire training set.\n\nBatch Normalisation allows for higher learning rates and makes the network less sensitive to initialisation and other optimisation choices, such as Dropout.\n\nSergey Ioffe, Christian Szegedy. “Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift.” (2015) https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167",

    "text": "7.2 Going Deeper\nThe realisation that deeper networks could generalise better sparked a race to build increasingly deep architectures after 2012. The primary obstacle was the vanishing gradient problem, which made it difficult to train sequential architectures like VGG beyond 14-16 layers.\nTo better understand the key to mitaging this problem, consider the simple sequential network of Figure 7.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: A simple sequential network.\n\n\n\nThe gradient of the error with respect to a weight w is a product of intermediate derivatives:\n\n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial  w} = \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial  u_2} \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial  u_1}  \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial  w}\n\nIf any of these intermediate derivatives is close to zero, the overall gradient \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial w} will also be close to zero, halting the learning process.\n\n\n\nNow, let us replace the layer containing u_2 with a network of three units in parallel (u_2, u_3, u_4):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: The same sequential network, with parallel pathes.\n\n\n\nThe gradient is now a sum of the gradients through these parallel paths:\n\n\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial  w} = \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial  u_2} \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial  u_1}  \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial  w}  + \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial  u_4} \\frac{\\partial u_4}{\\partial  u_1}  \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial  w} +  \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial  u_3} \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial  u_1}  \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial  w}\n\nWith this architecture, it is much less likely that the overall gradient will vanish, as all three terms would need to be null simultaneously.\nThis principle of introducing parallel paths is a key innovation in modern deep learning and was central to the designs of GoogLeNet (2014) and ResNet (2015).\n\n7.2.1 GoogLeNet: The Inception Module\nGoogLeNet, the winner of the ILSVRC 2014 competition, achieved a top-5 error rate of 6.7%, which was close to human-level performance at the time. This 22-layer deep CNN introduced the Inception module, a sub-network that processes the input through multiple parallel convolutional pathways.\n\nSzegedy et al. “Going Deeper with Convolutions”, CVPR 2015 (paper link)\n\nInstead of a simple sequence of convolutional layers, GoogLeNet uses a series of Inception modules (as highlighted by the green boxe in Figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: GoogLeNet Architecture (2015). The network is made of a sequence of inception modules (first one being highlighted in green).\n\n\n\nEach inception layer is a sub-network (hence the name inception) that produces 4 different types of convolutions filters, which are then concatenated (see this video for more explanations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: GoogLeNet Inception Sub-Network. Each module introduces 4 different parallel pathes.\n\n\n\nThe Inception module creates parallel paths that mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing us to go a bit deeper.\n\n\n7.2.2 ResNet: Residual Connections\nResNet is a 152 (yes, 152!!) layer network architecture that won the ILSVRC 2015 competition with an error rate of just 3.6%, surpassing human performance.\n\nKaiming He et al (2015). “Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition”. (paper link)\n\nSimilar to GoogLeNet, ResNet introduces parallel connections, but in a much simpler way. It uses residual connections, or skip connections, which add the input of a block of layers to its output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: ResNet Sub-Network. A direct path between the input and the output is formed through a Residual Connection.\n\n\n\nThe idea is very simple but allows for a very deep and very efficient architecture. Skip connections can not only skip individual convolution blocks, but also entire parts of the network.\nThe ResNet architecture has been highly influential, and many pre-trained variants, such as ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50, are still widely used today.",

    "section": "7.3 A Modern Training Pipeline",
    "text": "7.3 A Modern Training Pipeline\n\n7.3.1 Data Augmentation\nIt is often possible to artificially expand your dataset by generating variations of your existing input data. For images, common augmentation techniques include cropping, flipping, rotating, zooming, and adjusting contrast. These operations should not change the class of the image, so they provide a free and effective way to increase the size and diversity of the training set.\n\nsee PyTorch documentation\n\nSimilar techniques can be applied in other domains, such as adding noise, reverb, or compression to audio data.\nAnother approach is to synthesise data using simulation models, such as game engines. However, be aware that synthetic data is a simplified model of the real world and can lead to overfitting. It also tends to have different characteristics from real data, which can cause domain adaptation issues.\nGenerative models, such as those discussed in later chapters, can also be used to create synthetic data. For example, you could use a large language model to generate text for a natural language processing task.\n\n\n7.3.2 Initialisation\nInitialisation needs to be considered carefully. Starting with all weights at zero is generally a bad idea, as it can lead to being stuck in a local minimum with zero gradients from the outset. A better approach is to initialise the weights randomly. We need, however to be careful, and control the output at each layer to avoid a situation where gradients would explode or vanish through the different layers.\nFor networks using the ReLU activation function, He initialisation is a popular choice. For each layer l, the bias b and weights w are initialised as b_l=0, w_l\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\n\\sqrt{2/n_{l-1}}), where n_{l-1} is the number of neurons in the previous layer. This helps to maintain a stable gradient flow throughout the network, at least at the beginning of training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nsee PyTorch docs\nsee https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/initialization\nKaiming He et al. Delving Deep into Rectifiers (see paper)\nA quick overview of how this works is presented in Appendix E.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Optimisation\nAs discussed in previous chapters, various optimisation techniques are available for training. Adam and SGD with momentum are two of the most common choices. While Adam often converges faster, SGD with momentum has been shown to find local minima that generalise better. An improved version of Adam, called AdamW, has been proposed to address some of Adam’s shortcomings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother important aspect of optimisation is the learning rate schedule. Another aspect of the optimisation is the scheduling of the learning rate. It is generally beneficial to decrease the learning rate as the training progresses and the model approaches a local minimum.\nIn 2017 was popularised the idea of warm restarts, which periodically raise the learning rate to temporary diverge and allow to hop over hills. A variant of this scheme is the cosine annealing schedule shown in Figure 7.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Learning rate schedule using cosine annealing (2017).\n\n\n\nAn example of a reasonably modern optimiser setup in PyTorch might look like this:\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.optim.lr_scheduler import CosineAnnealingLR\n\n# Assuming you have your model defined and initial_learning_rate and decay_steps\n# For demonstration, let's assume some values\ninitial_learning_rate = 1e-3\ndecay_steps = 1000 \n\n# 1. Define your model\n# model = MyModel(...)\n\n# 2. Define the optimizer\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=initial_learning_rate)\n\n# 3. Define the learning rate scheduler\n# T_max is the number of iterations for the first half of the cosine cycle.\nscheduler = CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=decay_steps, eta_min=0) \n\n# 4. Training loop (simplified)\n# for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n#     for batch in dataloader:\n#         optimizer.zero_grad()\n#         # Forward pass, calculate loss\n#         loss.backward()\n#         optimizer.step()\n#         scheduler.step() # Call scheduler.step() after optimizer.step()\n\n\n7.3.4 Takeaways\nModern convolutional neural networks typically enhance the basic convolution-activation block with a combination of normalisation layers and residual connections. These additions make the networks more resilient to the vanishing gradient problem, enabling them to be much deeper and more effective for transfer learning.\nA modern training pipeline usually includes data augmentation, an initialisation strategy (such as He or Xavier initialisation), a well-chosen optimiser (like AdamW), and a dynamic learning rate schedule (such as cosine annealing). Often, a transfer learning approach is used to kick-start the training process.\nIt is important to remember that there are no universal truths in deep learning. These are popular and proven techniques, but they may not be optimal for your particular application. Remember that experimentation and careful evaluation are part of your daily grind as a deep learning practitioner.",

    "text": "8.1 A Feedforward Network Unrolled Over Time\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a specialised type of neural architecture designed to process sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, which process inputs independently, RNNs possess a form of memory that allows them to retain information from previous inputs in a sequence to inform future predictions.\nSequential data appears in many domains. Obvious examples include time series such as audio signals, stock market prices, or a vehicle’s trajectory. Text, which is a sequence of words or characters, is another prime example. In fact, RNNs were particularly successful in machine translation tasks during the early phase of the deep learning revolution.\nAt its core, an RNN works by recursively applying a function to each element of a sequence. The network maintains a hidden state, or context, which is updated at each step. This context captures information from all previous steps. As shown in Figure 8.1, this architecture is traditionally represented using a feedback loop in the graph.\nThe input stream, denoted by {\\bf x}, feeds into the context layer, denoted by {\\bf h}. This layer then re-uses the previously computed context, {\\bf h}_{t-1}, along with the current input, {\\bf x}_t, to compute the new context, {\\bf h}_t, and the output, {\\bf y}_t.\nFor those with a background in signal processing, an analogy can be drawn: if convolutional layers are akin to Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, then RNNs are similar to Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, as they incorporate feedback from previous states.\nTo better understand how an RNN operates, we can “unroll” or “unfold” the recursive loop (see Figure 8.2). This reveals a deep feedforward network where each layer corresponds to a single time step in the sequence.\nA key characteristic of RNNs is that the network parameters (weights and biases) are shared across all time steps. This means we use the same set of weights, w, at every iteration. This parameter sharing makes the network efficient, as it does not need to learn a new set of parameters for each point in the sequence, and it allows the model to generalise to sequences of varying lengths.\nFigure 8.3 shows an RNN in its most basic form, often called a simple RNN or an Elman network, where the hidden layer is simply a dense layer of neurons with a \\mathrm{tanh} activation function.\nWe typically use a \\mathrm{tanh} activation because its output ranges from -1 to 1. This allows the hidden state’s values to both increase and decrease.\nThe governing equations for a simple RNN at a time step t are:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\bf h}_{t}&=\\tanh({\\bf W}_{h}{\\bf x}_{t}+{\\bf U}_{h}{\\bf h}_{t-1}+{\\bf\nb}_{h})\\\\\n{\\bf y}_{t}&=\\sigma _{y}({\\bf W}_{y}{\\bf h}_{t}+{\\bf b}_{y})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nHere, {\\bf x}_t is the input vector at time t, {\\bf h}_t is the hidden state vector, and {\\bf y}_t is the output vector. The matrices {\\bf W}_{h}, {\\bf U}_{h}, and {\\bf W}_{y}, along with the bias vectors {\\bf b}_{h} and {\\bf b}_{y}, are the parameters that the network learns. Note that these parameters are the same for all time steps. \\sigma_y is the activation function for the output layer, chosen based on the specific task (e.g., softmax for classification).\nIn PyTorch, we can define a simple RNN layer with nn.RNN. The input shape is typically (n, p), where n is the number of time steps in the sequence and p is the number of features at each time step.\nIn practice, we would define it through a class as follows:\nHere the RNN layer returns the full sequence of hidden states, ie. one for each time step. Figure 8.4 illustrates this. The SimpleRNN layer outputs the hidden state for each time step. This is useful for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation or speech recognition, where we need an output at each step of the sequence.\nAn alternative shown in Figure 8.5 is when the RNN layer outputs only the hidden state from the very last time step. This is common when we need a single summary representation of the entire sequence, for instance, in a classification task where this final state is fed into a dense layer to predict a label for the whole sequence.\nNote that we can stack multiple RNN layers, much like we stack convolutional layers in a CNN. For instance:\nThis results in the deep architecture illustrated in Figure 8.6.",

    "text": "8.2 Application Example: Character-Level Language Modelling\nLet us explore a classic application of RNNs: building a character-level language model. The goal is to predict the next character in a piece of text, given the sequence of preceding characters. This is, in essence, our first look at a generative language model. The core idea is to train an RNN on a large corpus of text and have it learn the underlying statistical patterns of the language.\n\nTraining\nFirst, we must convert the text characters into a numerical format that the network can process. A common method is one-hot encoding, where each unique character in the vocabulary is represented by a binary vector with a single ‘1’ at the index corresponding to that character, and ’0’s everywhere else.\nThe training process is framed as a classification task. We feed the network a sequence of characters, for example {\\bf x}_1, \\dots, {\\bf\nx}_{n-1}, and train it to predict the next character, {\\bf y} = {\\bf\nx}_{n}. The network’s output layer will typically use a softmax activation function, which produces a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for the next character. The loss function used for training is usually cross-entropy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: An unrolled RNN used for next-character prediction.\n\n\n\nSo, the training objective is simple: given a sequence of previous characters, can the network accurately predict the character that comes next?\n\n\nInference\nOnce the RNN is trained, we can use it to generate new text, one character at a time. This process is known as inference or sampling. We begin by providing the network with an initial “seed” sequence (e.g., a few characters or words). The RNN processes this seed and outputs a probability distribution for the next character, as shown in Figure 8.8.\nTo generate the next character, we sample from this probability distribution. This means characters with a higher predicted probability are more likely to be chosen, but there is still an element of randomness. The newly generated character is then appended to the sequence, and this new, longer sequence is fed back into the RNN to generate the character after that. This process is repeated to generate entire sentences or even paragraphs of text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: The process of generating text one character at a time using a trained RNN.\n\n\n\nThis fun application was popularised in a seminal blog post by Andrej Karpathy. We recommend visiting the post for more examples and insights into the power of RNNs. As we will see in later chapters, this fundamental idea of sequential prediction is at the heart of modern Large Language Models (LLMs).",

    "text": "8.3 Training: Back-Propagation Through Time\nTo train an RNN, we need a method to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network’s parameters. Since the parameters are shared across all time steps, the gradient at a particular time step depends on all previous time steps.\nThe standard algorithm for this is Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT). It works by first unrolling the RNN into a deep feedforward network, as shown in Figure 8.9. Once unrolled, we can apply the standard back-propagation algorithm to calculate the gradients. The total gradient for a given parameter is the sum of the gradients for that parameter at each time step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT) involves unrolling the RNN and applying standard back-propagation.\n\n\n\nHowever, BPTT has its challenges. Unrolling the network for a long sequence can result in a very deep computational graph, which can consume a large amount of GPU memory. Furthermore, the process is inherently sequential, making it difficult to parallelise and slow to train.\nTo mitigate these issues, a common strategy is to split the long sequence into smaller chunks and apply BPTT only on these truncated parts. This approach is called Truncated Back-Propagation Through Time (TBPTT), illustrated in Figure 8.10. While this makes training more manageable, it comes at the cost of the network’s ability to learn dependencies that span longer than the chunk size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10: In Truncated BPTT, the RNN is unrolled for only a fixed number of time steps.",

    "section": "8.4 Dealing with Long Sequences",
    "text": "8.4 Dealing with Long Sequences\nWhen unrolled, recurrent networks can become very deep. As with any deep network, training with gradient descent is susceptible to the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. As the error is propagated back through many time steps, the gradients can either shrink exponentially until they become negligible (vanish) or grow exponentially until they become unstable (explode). This makes it very difficult for simple RNNs to learn long-range dependencies in the data.\nFor this reason, the simple RNN architecture is rarely used in practice. Instead, we resort to more sophisticated RNN architectures that were specifically designed to address this issue, namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).\n\n8.4.1 LSTM\nThe Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture was introduced in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) precisely to combat the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. LSTM cells (see Figure 8.11) replace the simple hidden layer of a standard RNN. They introduce a more complex internal structure that includes a separate cell state and a series of “gates” that regulate the flow of information.\nThese gates—the forget gate, input gate, and output gate—allow the network to selectively add or remove information from the cell state, enabling it to remember information for very long periods. After their potential was realised around 2014, major technology companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft began using LSTMs extensively in products for speech recognition and machine translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.11: The internal architecture of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell. (Figure by François Deloche).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nS. Hochreiter and J. Schmidhuber (1997). “Long short-term memory” original paper\nKeras’s LSTM documentation\nSee also Brandon’s Rohrer’s video\nand colah’s blog\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 GRU\nThe Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) was introduced in 2014 (Chung et al. 2014) as a simpler alternative to the LSTM. GRUs combine the forget and input gates into a single “update gate” and merge the cell state and hidden state. This results in a model that is computationally more efficient (faster to train) because it has fewer parameters than an LSTM.\nThe performance of GRUs is often comparable to that of LSTMs. They may perform slightly better on smaller datasets but can be outperformed by LSTMs on larger, more complex problems. The architecture is shown in Figure 8.12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.12: The internal architecture of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cell. (Figure by François Deloche).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nJ. Chung, C. Gulcehre, K. Cho and Y. Bengio (2014). “Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling”. (original paper)\nKeras GRU documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Gated Units\nWithout delving too deeply into the equations of LSTMs and GRUs, it is useful to understand the core concept they introduce: gated units. So far, the primary way we have combined information from two units, u_1 and u_2, has been through a linear combination, w_1u_1 + w_2u_2. Gating provides an alternative mechanism based on element-wise multiplication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.13: A gated unit, where u_1 controls the flow of information from u_2.\n\n\n\nA gate is typically a vector produced by a sigmoid activation function, \\sigma(u_1), whose values range between 0 and 1. This gate then acts as a filter on another vector, u_2. When a value in the gate is close to 0, the corresponding feature in u_2 is blocked. When it is close to 1, the feature is allowed to pass through.\nTo build some intuition, consider a text processing example where u_2 is a vector representing the probability of the next word:\n\nu_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\vdots \\\\ p(\\text{bat --- the animal}) = 0.4\n  \\\\ p(\\text{bat --- the stick}) = 0.3\n  \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix}\n\nHere, the word “bat” is ambiguous. The role of the gate, \\sigma(u_1), which is computed from the prior context, could be to resolve this ambiguity:\n\n\\sigma(u_1) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\vdots \\\\ 0.96 \\\\ 0.04\n  \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix}\n\nMultiplying the two vectors element-wise effectively filters out the unwanted meaning:\n\nu_2 \\odot \\sigma(u_1) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\vdots \\\\ 0.4 \\\\ 0.3 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix} \\odot \\begin{bmatrix} \\vdots \\\\ 0.96 \\\\ 0.04 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix} =  \\begin{bmatrix} \\vdots \\\\ 0.384 \\\\ 0.012 \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix}\n\nIn LSTMs and GRUs, this gating mechanism is used to control the cell state, allowing the network to learn what information to store, what to forget, and what to output at each time step.",

    "text": "8.7 Limitations of RNNs and the Rise of Transformers\nDespite their success, RNNs have fundamental limitations. Their inherently recurrent nature, processing data one step at a time, prevents effective parallelisation. This makes them slow to train on very long sequences.\nPerhaps more critically, RNNs and LSTMs are not well-suited for transfer learning in the same way as CNNs. It is difficult to pre-train a general-purpose RNN on a massive dataset and then fine-tune it for a new task. Consequently, most RNN applications require training from scratch, which demands large amounts of task-specific data and significant computational resources.\nThe 2017 landmark paper “Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al. 2017) introduced the Transformer architecture, which has since ended the predominance of RNNs in natural language processing. Transformers, built upon the Attention Mechanism, dispense with recurrence entirely. Their design allows for massive parallelisation and has proven exceptionally effective for transfer learning. This has enabled the creation of powerful pre-trained models like BERT and GPT, which can be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This is why we will cover these in the next chapters.\n… but good ideas never die. Recurrent approaches made a comeback in late 2023 with Mamba, an architecture demonstrating that state-space models with recurrent properties can compete with, and sometimes outperform, Transformers, particularly in terms of computational efficiency during inference.

    "text": "9.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nUntil now, our focus has primarily been on discriminative models. These models are trained to learn the boundary between different classes of data. Their goal is to estimate the conditional probability P(Y | X): given an input X, what is the probability of the label Y? Logistic regression, SVMs, and standard feed-forward classifiers are all examples of discriminative models. They are the workhorses of supervised learning, where we learn from a dataset of inputs {\\bf X} that have been explicitly paired with ground-truth labels {\\bf y}.\nIn this chapter, we shift our focus to a different paradigm: generative models. Instead of learning to distinguish between classes, generative models aim to learn the underlying probability distribution of the data itself. Their goal is to model P(X) (the distribution of the data) or P(X | Y) (the distribution of data belonging to a specific class). The ultimate objective is to synthesise new data that is statistically similar to the data the model was trained on.\nBecause the goal is to learn the inherent structure of the data without relying on explicit labels, generative modelling is often a form of unsupervised learning.\nDeep learning has given rise to several powerful families of generative models, including:\nIn this module, we will provide an introduction to GANs, Autoencoders, and Auto-Regressive Models.\nFor several years, Generative Adversarial Networks were the dominant force in generative modelling, producing stunningly realistic images. The core idea, introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014, is both elegant and powerful. It frames the learning process as a two-player game.\nA GAN consists of two neural networks that are trained in opposition to one another:\nThe training process is an adversarial game:\nThis creates an arms race. The Generator and Discriminator are trained alternately. A better Discriminator provides a more informative loss signal for the Generator, pushing it to create better fakes. In turn, a better Generator provides more challenging training data for the Discriminator. When this process reaches equilibrium, the Generator is producing samples that are so realistic that the Discriminator can do no better than random guessing.\nTraining GANs is notoriously difficult and unstable, but the results can be spectacular. They have been used to generate hyper-realistic images, artwork, and even music.",

    "text": "9.2 Autoencoders: Learning to Compress and Reconstruct\nAutoencoders are a form of unsupervised learning where the learning signal comes from the data itself. The goal is simple: train a network to reconstruct its own input as faithfully as possible. While this sounds like a trivial task (the identity function would solve it perfectly), the key is that we force the data to pass through a bottleneck layer with a much lower dimensionality than the input.\nAn autoencoder consists of two parts:\n\nThe Encoder: This part of the network takes the high-dimensional input data {\\bf x} and compresses it into a low-dimensional latent representation {\\bf z}.\nThe Decoder: This part takes the latent representation {\\bf z} and attempts to reconstruct the original input data, producing {\\bf \\hat{x}}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: The general architecture of an Autoencoder.\n\n\n\nThe network is trained to minimise a reconstruction loss, which measures the difference between the original input {\\bf x} and the reconstructed output {\\bf \\hat{x}}. For continuous data like images, this is typically the Mean Squared Error (L2 loss). For categorical data, it would be the cross-entropy loss.\nBy forcing the network to squeeze all the necessary information through the low-dimensional bottleneck, we compel it to learn a meaningful, compressed representation of the data. This process is a form of non-linear dimensionality reduction, similar in spirit to Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n\n9.2.1 The Problem of the Latent Space\nWhile autoencoders are excellent for tasks like denoising or dimensionality reduction, they are not inherently good generative models. The reason lies in the structure of the latent space—the space of all possible latent vectors {\\bf z}.\nA standard autoencoder makes no guarantees about the structure of this space. The encoder might learn to map input images to disconnected clusters in the latent space, with large gaps in between. If we were to pick a point {\\bf z} from one of these gaps and feed it to the decoder, the resulting reconstruction {\\bf \\hat{x}} would likely be a blurry, meaningless mess, because the decoder was never trained on such a point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: A scatter plot of the MNIST dataset in the 2D latent space of a standard autoencoder. The clusters for each digit are irregularly shaped and have gaps between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Decoding points from the latent space. In the gaps between clusters, the reconstructions are not valid digits.\n\n\n\nTo build a true generative model, we need a latent space that is smooth, continuous, and well-structured, so that we can sample any point {\\bf z} and be confident that the decoder will produce a valid output. This is the problem that Variational Autoencoders were designed to solve.\n\n\n9.2.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a more sophisticated type of autoencoder that makes them suitable for generation. They do this by introducing a probabilistic spin on the encoder and adding a new term to the loss function that enforces a regular structure on the latent space.\nInstead of mapping an input {\\bf x} to a single point {\\bf z} in the latent space, the VAE encoder maps it to a probability distribution— specifically, a Gaussian distribution defined by a mean vector \\boldsymbol{\\mu} and a variance vector \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^2. The latent vector {\\bf z} is then sampled from this distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: The architecture of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).\n\n\n\nThe VAE loss function has two components:\n\nThe Reconstruction Loss: This is the same as in a standard AE. It pushes the model to accurately reconstruct the input.\nThe Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence Loss: This is the key addition. It measures how much the distribution produced by the encoder (\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu},\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^2)) differs from a standard normal distribution (\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{I})). This loss term acts as a regulariser, forcing the encoder to learn distributions that are centred around the origin and have unit variance. This ensures that the latent space is continuous and densely packed, without the gaps we saw in the standard AE.\n\nBy balancing these two losses, the VAE learns a smooth, structured latent space that is ideal for generation. To create a new sample, we no longer need an input image. We simply sample a random point {\\bf z} from the standard normal distribution (\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})) and pass it to the decoder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: The latent space of a VAE. The clusters are now much more regular and compact, resembling a Gaussian distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Decoding from the VAE’s latent space. The transitions between digits are smooth, and there are no major gaps.",

    "text": "10.1.1 The Problem with CNNs and RNNs\nRecurrent Neural Networks (such as LSTMs and GRUs) were, for a long time, the model of choice for sequence processing tasks. Their recurrent nature makes them a natural fit for handling variable-length inputs like sentences. However, they have several drawbacks:\n\nThe sequential nature of RNNs prohibits parallelisation. Each step depends on the previous one, making them slow to train on long sequences.\nThe context is computed from the past only, meaning the representation of a word only depends on the words that came before it. Bidirectional RNNs mitigate this, but they are even more computationally expensive.\nThere is no explicit distinction between short-term and long-term dependencies; everything is handled by the same recurrent state, which can become a bottleneck.\nTraining RNNs can be tricky due to vanishing and exploding gradient problems.\nIt is not straightforward to apply transfer learning efficiently.\n\nOn the other hand, Convolutional Neural Networks, which are dominant in computer vision, can also be applied to sequences (using 1D convolutions). They offer several advantages:\n\nThey can be massively parallelised, as the output at each position can be computed independently.\nThey are excellent at exploiting local dependencies (within the kernel’s receptive field). Long-range dependencies can be captured by stacking multiple layers.\n\nHowever, CNNs also have their own limitations when it comes to text:\n\nThey are not designed to handle variable-sized inputs without padding or truncation, which can lead to a loss of information.\nThe dependencies they capture are at fixed positions relative to the current word, which is a rigid assumption for language.\n\n\n\n10.1.2 The Problem with Positional Dependencies\nLet us examine the issue of fixed positional dependencies more closely. Consider a simple 1D convolution on a sequence of feature vectors {\\bf x}_i with a kernel size of 5. To simplify the argument, we will ignore cross-channel interactions:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\text{output}_i = w_{-2} {\\bf x}_{i-2} + w_{-1} {\\bf x}_{i-1} + w_{0} {\\bf x}_{i} + w_{1}\n  {\\bf x}_{i+1} + w_{+2} {\\bf x}_{i+2} + b,\n\\end{equation}\nThe weight w_{-1} is always associated with the dependency relationship between the current sample and the previous one (i.e., a distance of 1 in the past). This relationship is assumed to be the same across all sentences.\nNow, consider a dense (fully connected) layer, again ignoring cross-channel interactions:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\text{output}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^L w_{i,j} {\\bf x}_{j} + b,\n\\end{equation}\nHere, we face a similar issue: the relationships are defined according to fixed absolute positions. For example, the weight w_{1,3} captures the relationship between the first and third words, and this is assumed to be the same for all sentences, regardless of their content.\nHowever, in natural language, dependencies are not so rigid. Look at the dependency graph for a typical sentence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Example of a Sentence Dependency Graph\n\n\n\nThe distances between related words are not fixed. For instance, the verb is not always the word immediately following the subject. Convolutional and Dense layers are not well equipped to handle such flexible relationships.\nSo, what is the problem? Can we not just make the network bigger?\nYes, the Universal Approximation Theorem tells us that we can always throw more filters or neurons at the problem. In theory, a large enough network could learn all possible dependency graphs. However, this is clearly not an optimal approach. It is inefficient and would require vast amounts of data.\nThis is where the Attention Mechanism comes to the rescue. It provides a way to learn these dependencies dynamically.",

    "section": "10.2 The Attention Mechanism",
    "text": "10.2 The Attention Mechanism\nThe Attention Mechanism was originally introduced in the context of machine translation and image captioning, where it was used to align different parts of an image with words in a sentence (Xu et al. 2015). The idea was quickly adapted to model relationships between words within a single sentence Luong, Pham, and Manning (2015).\nSince its inception, the Attention Mechanism has been iterated upon in many papers, leading to various forms (e.g., Bahdanau Attention, Luong Attention). Here, we will focus on the Scaled Dot-Product Attention used in the Transformer model, as it is arguably the most popular and influential.\n\n10.2.1 Core Mechanism of a Dot-Product Attention Layer\nLet us revisit the formulation of a Dense layer:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\text{output}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^L w_{i,j} {\\bf x}_{j} + b,\n\\end{equation}\nThe core idea of Attention is that, instead of learning a fixed set of weights w_{i,j}, we could devise a recipe to generate these weights on the fly, based on the input data itself. For instance, we could have something like this:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{output}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^L f({\\bf x}_{i},\n{\\bf x}_{j}) {\\bf x}_{j},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere f would be a function that computes the weights dynamically.\nTaking our previous NLP example, the word is is clearly a verb and hearing is a subject. We could therefore imagine that the weight w_{\\text{is},\\text{hearing}} could be defined based purely on the semantics of {\\bf x}_\\text{is} and {\\bf x}_\\text{hearing}, regardless of their actual positions in the sentence:\n\\begin{equation}\nw_{\\text{is},\\text{hearing}} = f({\\bf x}_\\text{is},\n{\\bf x}_\\text{hearing}).\n\\end{equation}\nThis is the central idea behind Attention. Let us now see how it is implemented in practice.\nTo make the explanation more generic, we will consider two sequences of vectors: a sequence of queries, {\\bf q}_1, \\dots, {\\bf q}_{L_q}, and a sequence of keys, {\\bf k}_1, \\dots, {\\bf k}_{L_k}. The terms keys and queries draw an analogy to a retrieval or database system (see later). In the following example, we will focus on computing the output for a single query, {\\bf q}_3:\nThe Attention layer computes an alignment score, s, between the query {\\bf q}_{3} and each of the keys, {\\bf k}_{1}, \\dots, {\\bf k}_{4}:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2\n\n\n\nMany formulae for the alignment score exist. The formula used in the Transformer paper is based on the scaled dot product of the feature vectors:\n\\begin{equation}\n     s_{i,j} = {\\bf q}_{i}^{\\top} {\\bf k}_{j} / \\sqrt{d_k}\n\\end{equation}\n(Note: the normalisation by the square root of the key dimension, d_k, is an important detail that was found to help stabilise training).\nThe scores, s, are analogous to logits: a large score (+\\infty) means that the query and key are highly related. A softmax function can then be used to normalise these scores into a set of weights that sum to 1:\n\\begin{equation}\n  [w_{3,1}; w_{3,2}; w_{3,3}; w_{3,4}]\n  = \\mathrm{softmax}(  [s_{3,1} ; s_{3,2} ; s_{3,3} ; s_{3,4}])\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\nInstead of combining the keys, we use these weights to form a weighted sum of a third set of vectors, the values, {\\bf v}_1, \\dots, {\\bf v}_{L_k} (again, note the analogy to a retrieval system):\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\mathrm{output}_3 = w_{3,1} {\\bf v}_1 + w_{3,2} {\\bf v}_2 + w_{3,3} {\\bf v}_3 + w_{3,4} {\\bf v}_4\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3\n\n\n\nWe can repeat this operation for all other query vectors, for example, for {\\bf q}_5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4\n\n\n\nIn summary, an Attention layer takes three tensors as input:\n\nA tensor of queries, {\\bf Q}=[{\\bf q_1}, \\dots, {\\bf q_{L_q}}]^{\\top}, of size L_q \\times d_q, where L_q is the length of the query sequence and d_q is the dimension of the query feature vectors.\nA tensor of keys, {\\bf K}=[{\\bf k_1}, \\dots, {\\bf k_{L_k}}]^{\\top}, of size L_k \\times d_k.\nA tensor of values, {\\bf V} = [{\\bf v_1}, \\dots, {\\bf v_{L_k}}]^{\\top}, of size L_k \\times d_v.\n\nNote that the key and query dimensions must be equal (d_k = d_q), while the value dimension, d_v, can be different.\nThe values can be thought of as the context vectors associated with each word, similar to what we would have in an RNN. The queries and keys are different representations of the input words, used to determine how they relate to each other.\nGiven these three tensors, the Attention layer returns a new tensor of size L_q \\times d_v, where each output vector is a weighted average of the value vectors:\n\\begin{equation}\n     \\text{output}_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{L_k} w_{i,j} {\\bf v}_{j}\n\\end{equation}\nOn the face of it, this looks like a dense layer, as each output vector is a linear combination of the value vectors. The crucial difference is that the weights, w_{i,j}, are computed dynamically as a function of how well the query {\\bf q}_i aligns with the key {\\bf k}_j:\n\\begin{equation}\n     s_{i,j} = {\\bf q}_{i}^{\\top} {\\bf k}_{j} / \\sqrt{d_k}\n\\end{equation}\nThese scores are then normalised using a softmax function:\n\\begin{equation}\n     w_{i,j} = \\frac{\\exp(s_{i,j})}{\\sum_{l=1}^{L_k} \\exp(s_{i,l})} \\quad \\text{so\n       as to have $\\sum_j w_{i,j} = 1$ and $0 \\leq w_{i,j} \\leq 1$. }\n\\end{equation}\nIn other words, for each query vector {\\bf q}_i:\n\nWe evaluate the alignment/similarity between {\\bf q}_i and all the keys {\\bf k}_j:\n\\begin{equation}\ns_{i,j} = {\\bf q}_i^\\top {\\bf k}_j / \\sqrt{d_k}\n\\end{equation}\nThe scores are then normalised across all keys using softmax to obtain the weights w_{i,j}:\n\\begin{equation}\n     w_{i,j} = \\frac{\\exp(s_{i,j})}{\\sum_{l=1}^{L_k} \\exp(s_{i,l})}\n\\end{equation}\nWe compute the output vector as the weighted average of the value vectors {\\bf v}_j:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\text{output}_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{L_k} w_{i,j} {\\bf v}_{j}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n10.2.2 The Attention Mechanism as a Fuzzy Dictionary Lookup\nNow that the mechanic is understood, let’s revisit the retrieval analogy. The attention mechanism can be understood as a differentiable, “fuzzy” version of a key-value lookup, such as one performed with a Python dictionary.\nConsider a simple dictionary named capital that maps countries to their capital cities:\ncapital = {\n    \"France\": \"Paris\",\n    \"UK\": \"London\",\n    \"Germany\": \"Berlin\"\n}\nIn the language of attention, we can represent these pairs as keys ({\\bf k}) and values ({\\bf v}):\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\bf k}_1 &\\equiv \\text{`France'}  & ; \\quad & {\\bf v}_1 &\\equiv \\ \\text{`Paris'} \\\\\n{\\bf k}_2 &\\equiv \\text{`UK'}        & ; \\quad & {\\bf v}_2 &\\equiv \\ \\text{`London'} \\\\\n{\\bf k}_3 &\\equiv \\text{`Germany'}  & ; \\quad & {\\bf v}_3 &\\equiv \\ \\text{`Berlin'} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\nA standard dictionary performs a “hard” lookup. If we provide the query 'France', it finds an exact match with key {\\bf k}_1 and returns the single corresponding value {\\bf v}_1.\nWe can model this hard lookup using an attention-like process. Imagine a hypothetical alignment score function that returns +\\infty if the query and key strings are identical, and -\\infty if they differ. When we apply the softmax function to these scores, the weights become either 1 for a perfect match or 0 otherwise.\nLet’s pose the query {\\bf q}_1 \\equiv \\text{`France'}. The alignment scores with our keys ({\\bf k}_1, {\\bf k}_2, {\\bf k}_3) would be (+\\infty, -\\infty, -\\infty). Applying the softmax function to these scores yields the attention weights:\n\n(w_{1,1}, w_{1,2}, w_{1,3}) = \\text{softmax}(+\\infty, -\\infty, -\\infty) = (1, 0,\n0)\n\nThe output is then the weighted sum of the values:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{output}_1 &= \\sum_{j=1}^{3} w_{1,j} {\\bf v}_{j} \\\\\n&= (1 \\times {\\bf v}_1) + (0 \\times {\\bf v}_2) + (0 \\times {\\bf v}_3) \\\\\n&\\equiv \\text{`Paris'}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThis perfectly mimics the dictionary lookup.\nThe actual attention mechanism is a “soft” or “fuzzy” lookup. By using similarity measure (like the our dot product) between vector representations, a query for 'French Republic' might result in high, but not absolute, similarity to 'France', yielding attention weights like (0.95, 0.03, 0.02). The resulting output would be a blend of the values, heavily weighted towards 'Paris'. This allows the model to relax the requirement to have a single exact match.\n\n\n10.2.3 No Trainable Parameters\nAs we loop through the queries and keys, the number of similarity scores to compute is L_q \\times L_k. Each similarity calculation takes \\mathcal{O}(d_k) operations, so the overall computational complexity is \\mathcal{O}(L_q \\times L_k \\times d_k). This is very similar in complexity to a dense layer (except that we do not try to have cross-channel weights).\nImportantly, because we have a formula to compute the weights, the Attention mechanism itself does not have any trainable parameters. This becomes apparent when we write down the full mathematical formula in matrix form:\n\\begin{equation} \\small \\text{Attention}({\\bf Q}, {\\bf K}, {\\bf V}) =\n  \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(\\frac{{\\bf Q} {\\bf K}^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) {\\bf V}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the \\mathrm{softmax} function is applied row-wise.\n\n\n10.2.4 Self-Attention\nSelf-Attention is a special case of the Attention mechanism where the queries, keys, and values are all derived from a single input tensor, {\\bf X} = [{\\bf x}_1, {\\bf x}_2, \\cdots, {\\bf x}_L]^{\\top} of size L \\times d. This is achieved by using three separate linear transformations to project the input tensor into the query, key, and value spaces:\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\bf q}_i = {\\bf W}_Q^{\\top} {\\bf x}_i,\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\bf k}_i = {\\bf W}_K^{\\top} {\\bf x}_i,\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\bf v}_i = {\\bf W}_V^{\\top} {\\bf x}_i .\n\\end{equation}\nThe Self-Attention output is therefore given by:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{Self-Attention}({\\bf X}, {\\bf W}_Q, {\\bf W}_K, {\\bf W}_V) = \\\\\n\\text{Attention}({\\bf X}{\\bf W}_Q, {\\bf X}{\\bf W}_K, {\\bf X}{\\bf W}_V)\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nIf we substitute the definitions, we get the following all-in-one equation:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{Self-Attention}({\\bf X}) = \\mathrm{softmax}\\left(\\frac{({\\bf X} {\\bf W_Q})({\\bf X} {\\bf W_K})^\\top }{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) ({{\\bf X} {\\bf W}_V})\n\\end{equation}\nIn this formulation, the only trainable parameters are contained in the weight matrices {\\bf W}_Q (size d \\times d_q), {\\bf W}_K (size d \\times d_k), and {\\bf W}_V (size d \\times d_v). These are relatively small matrices, and crucially, they can operate on sequences of any length, since their dimensions do not depend on the sequence length L.\nThe code presented below is python/numpy implementation of how the attention vector for the first token/word in the sequence can be computed. This code would need to be also applied to all the other words in the sequence.\n\ndef softmax(x):\n  return(np.exp(x)/np.exp(x).sum())\n\n# encoder representations of four different words\nword_1 = np.array([1, 0, 0]); word_2 = np.array([0, 1, 0]);\nword_3 = np.array([1, 1, 0]); word_4 = np.array([0, 0, 1])\n\n# initialisation of the weight matrices\n# These would be learned during training\nW_Q = np.random.randn(3, 2) # d=3, d_q=2\nW_K = np.random.randn(3, 2) # d=3, d_k=2\nW_V = np.random.randn(3, 2) # d=3, d_v=2\n\n# generating the queries, keys and values\nquery_1 = word_1 @ W_Q; key_1 = word_1 @ W_K; value_1 = word_1 @ W_V\nquery_2 = word_2 @ W_Q; key_2 = word_2 @ W_K; value_2 = word_2 @ W_V\nquery_3 = word_3 @ W_Q; key_3 = word_3 @ W_K; value_3 = word_3 @ W_V\nquery_4 = word_4 @ W_Q; key_4 = word_4 @ W_K; value_4 = word_4 @ W_V\n\n# scoring the first query vector against all key vectors\nscores_1 = np.array([np.dot(query_1, key_1), np.dot(query_1, key_2),\n                     np.dot(query_1, key_3), np.dot(query_1, key_4)])\n\n# computing the weights by a softmax operation\nweights_1 = softmax(scores_1 / np.sqrt(key_1.shape[0]))\n\n# computing the first attention vector\nattention_1 = (weights_1[0] * value_1 + weights_1[1] * value_2 +\n               weights_1[2] * value_3 + weights_1[3] * value_4)\n \nprint(attention_1)\n\n\n10.2.5 Computational Complexity\nSince each feature vector in the sequence is compared to all other feature vectors, the computational complexity is quadratic in the input sequence length, L. This is similar to a dense layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nComplexity\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Attention\n\\mathcal{O}(L^2 \\cdot d_k)\n\n\nRNN/LSTM/GRU\n\\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot d \\cdot d_v)\n\n\nConvolution\n\\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot \\text{kernel\\_size} \\cdot d \\cdot d_v)\n\n\nDense Layer\n\\mathcal{O}(L^2 \\cdot d \\cdot d_v)\n\n\n\nNote that we typically choose the key dimension, d_k, to be much smaller than the input dimension, d (e.g., d_k = d/8). This reduces the computational cost, but it remains quadratic in the sequence length, L. The idea is that each attention head only needs to look at one aspect of the relationship between words, for instance, the subject-verb relationship.\nLike Dense Layers and Convolutions, Attention can be easily parallelised. We could also restrict the attention mechanism to a local neighbourhood to reduce the complexity from \\mathcal{O}(L^2) to \\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot w), where w is the window size.\nMore than the computational complexity, however, the number of trainable parameters is what is particularly interesting. The number of parameters in Self-Attention does not depend on the sequence length, which is a significant advantage over RNNs and Dense Layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nNumber of Trainable Parameters\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Attention\n\\mathcal{O}(d \\cdot d_q + d \\cdot d_k + d \\cdot d_v)\n\n\nRNN/LSTM/GRU\n\\mathcal{O}(d \\cdot d_v + d_v^2)\n\n\nConvolution\n\\mathcal{O}(\\text{kernel\\_size} \\cdot d \\cdot d_v)\n\n\nDense Layer\n\\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot d \\cdot d_v)\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.6 A Perfect Tool for Multi-Modal Processing\nAttention is a versatile tool that allows for great flexibility in the design of the input tensors {\\bf Q}, {\\bf K}, and {\\bf V}. For instance, if we have one tensor derived from text and another from audio, we can fuse them using Cross-Attention:\n\\begin{equation}\n  {\\bf V}_{\\text{audio}/\\text{text}} = \\text{Attention}({\\bf\n    Q}_{\\text{audio}}, {\\bf K}_{\\text{text}},  {\\bf V}_{\\text{text}})\n\\end{equation}\nThe sources do not need to be perfectly synchronised. That is, the text key and value vectors do not need to align perfectly with the audio query vectors (see exercise below). In fact, the sources do not even need to be of the same length (L_q \\neq L_k). For these reasons, Attention is very well suited for combining multi-modal inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nShow that the output of the Attention layer is the same if the entries of the keys and values tensors are permuted in the same way, e.g.:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{Attention}(\n     [{\\bf q}_1,\\dots,{{\\bf q}_{L_q}} ],\n     [{\\bf k}_1,\\dots,{{\\bf k}_{L_k}} ],\n     [{\\bf v}_1,\\dots,{{\\bf v}_{L_k}} ])\n      = \\\\\n\\text{Attention}(\n     [{\\bf q}_1,\\dots,{{\\bf q}_{L_q}} ],\n     [{\\bf k}_{L_k}, {\\bf k}_{{L_k}-1}, \\dots,{{\\bf k}_1} ],\n     [{\\bf v}_{L_k}, {\\bf v}_{{L_k}-1}, \\dots,{{\\bf v}_1} ])\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n10.2.7 The Multi-Head Attention Layer\nYou can think of an Attention layer as a replacement for a convolution layer. Just as you can chain multiple convolutional layers, you can also chain multiple Attention layers.\nIn Transformers, a set of \\left({\\bf W}_{Q}, {\\bf W}_{K}, {\\bf W}_{V}\\right) matrices is called an attention head. A Multi-Head Attention layer is simply a layer that contains multiple attention heads. The outputs of these heads are concatenated and then linearly transformed back to the expected dimension.\nThe number of heads is a hyperparameter, analogous to the number of filters in a convolutional layer. Each head can learn to focus on different types of relationships between words. For example, one head might learn to capture syntactic dependencies, while another might focus on semantic similarity.\nBelow is an example in Keras of a self-attention layer with two heads:\nx  = tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(\n         num_heads=2, key_dim=2, value_dim=3)(\n         query=x, key=x, value=x)\nHere, we would define two sets of \\left({\\bf W}_{Q}, {\\bf W}_{K}, {\\bf W}_{V}\\right) matrices, with d_k=2 and d_v=3 for each head.\n\n\n10.2.8 Takeaways (Attention Mechanism)\n\nRNNs do not parallelise well, and Convolutions assume fixed positional relationships, which is not ideal for text.\nThe Attention Mechanism resolves these issues by defining a formula to dynamically compute the weights between any two positions, i and j, based on the alignment (dot-product) between a query vector for i and a key vector for j.\nWith Self-Attention, linear transformation matrices are used to produce the queries, keys, and value vectors from a single input tensor.\nThe computational complexity of Attention is quadratic in the input sequence length (as with Dense Layers). The Attention mechanism itself has no trainable parameters, but Self-Attention requires learning the projection matrices {\\bf W}_Q, {\\bf W}_K, and {\\bf W}_V.\nSelf-Attention and Cross-Attention are well suited for text processing, as the semantics of the words can take precedence over their absolute or relative positions.\nCross-Attention is a powerful tool for working with multiple modalities (e.g., audio, video, images, text), as it is agnostic to the positions of the keys and values and can thus handle potential synchronisation issues.",

    "section": "10.3 Transformers",
    "text": "10.3 Transformers\nIn 2017, Vaswani et al. proposed the Transformer, a simple yet powerful network architecture based solely on attention layers. This architecture has fundamentally impacted not only text processing but the entire field of deep learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention Is All You Need\n\n\n\nA. Vaswani et al. Attention Is All You Need. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 5998–6008. (2017)\noriginal paper\n\n\nThe original publication has generated over 57,000 citations as of 2022 (for reference, a paper is considered highly successful if it has over 100 citations).\n\n10.3.1 An Encoder-Decoder Architecture\nThe Transformer architecture, as described in the original paper, is an encoder-decoder model, as shown in Figure 10.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: The Transformer architecture, as described in the original paper (with the encoder and decoder parts highlighted in magenta).\n\n\n\nThe first part of the network (highlighted in magenta) is an encoder, which is a sub-network that transforms the input sequence into a meaningful, compact tensor representation. Think of it as being analogous to the VGG network, which transforms an image into a compact 4096 \\times 1 feature vector. As with VGG, the idea is that this pre-trained encoder can be reused for other tasks through transfer learning.\nThe Encoder itself is made of a stack of identical blocks. At the core of each of these blocks is a Multi-Head Attention layer, followed by a simple feed-forward network.\nBelow is an example of what an implementation of that encoder could look like.\ndef encoder_block(inputs):\n    # Multi-head self-attention\n    x = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=2, key_dim=2)(\n          query=inputs, key=inputs, value=inputs)\n    x = Dropout(0.1)(x)\n    # Residual connection and layer normalisation\n    attn = LayerNormalization()(inputs + x)\n    \n    # Feed Forward layer (a simple 1x1 convolution)\n    x = Conv1D(filters=ff_dim, kernel_size=1, activation=\"relu\")(attn)\n    x = Dropout(dropout)(x)\n    x = Conv1D(filters=inputs.shape[-1], kernel_size=1)(x)\n    # Residual connection and layer normalisation\n    return LayerNormalization()(attn + x)\n    \ndef encoder(x, n_blocks):\n    for _ in range(n_blocks):\n        x = encoder_block(x)\n    return x\nThe Decoder, also highlighted in magenta, is also made of a stack of blocks containing Multi-Head Attention layers. Its job is to take the encoder’s output and generate the target sequence.\n\n\n10.3.2 Positional Encoding\nNote the presence of a Positional Encoding layer at the input. As the Attention mechanism itself is permutation-invariant, it does not have any notion of word order. To remedy this, the Transformer architecture proposes to encode the position of each word as a vector and add it to the input embedding.\nThe positional encoding is a function \\phi: i \\mapsto \\phi(i) that maps a position i to a vector. This vector is then simply appended to the word embedding: {\\bf x}'_i = [{\\bf x}_i; \\phi(i)].\nWhy do we need a special encoding for this? Why not simply use the index of the word as a feature, i.e., \\phi(i) = i?\nThis is because the similarity measure needs to make sense. If we used the dot product, the similarity between positions i and j would simply be i \\times j. We would prefer the similarity to be high for nearby positions and low for distant ones. For example, we would like \\phi(i)^\\top \\phi(j) to be large if i \\approx j and small otherwise.\nA function that has this property is the Gaussian kernel: \\begin{equation}\n\\phi(i)^\\top \\phi(j) \\approx \\exp( - \\lambda (i-j)^2).\n\\end{equation}\nSo such an embedding exists: it is the (infinite) Fourier series basis (the same as in the RBF kernel in SVM). As we cannot afford the luxury of an infinite embedding, we need to truncate the series. This is what was proposed in the original Transformer paper. For a positional encoding of dimension d_{pos}, they propose:\n\\begin{equation}\ni \\mapsto \\phi(i) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\sin(\\omega_1 i) \\\\\n  \\cos(\\omega_1 i) \\\\\n  \\sin(\\omega_2 i) \\\\\n  \\cos(\\omega_2 i) \\\\\n  \\vdots \\\\\n  \\sin(\\omega_{d_{pos}/2} i) \\\\\n  \\cos(\\omega_{d_{pos}/2} i)\n\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{where } \\omega_k = 1/10000^{2k/d_{pos}}\n\\end{equation}\nThe advantage of using a positional encoding, as opposed to hard-coding positional relationships as in a CNN, is that the position is treated as just another piece of information. It can be transformed, combined with other features, or even ignored by the network. It is up to the training process to learn how to best use this information.\n\n\n10.3.3 Takeaways (Transformers)\nThere is obviously a lot more to know about Transformers, but we have covered the main ideas here.\n\nThe Transformer model is an encoder-decoder architecture based on blocks of Attention layers.\nThe positional information, which is lost in the attention mechanism, is re-introduced by adding a positional encoding to the input vectors.\nTransformers benefit from the efficiency of the Attention Mechanism, requiring fewer parameters than RNNs for similar performance, and can be easily parallelised.\nTransformers are the backbone of modern NLP networks such as ChatGPT. They are also the backbone of many models that handle multiple modalities (e.g., text, images, speech).\n\n\n\n\n\nBahdanau, Dzmitry, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015. “Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate.” In 3rd International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2015, San Diego, CA, USA, May 7-9, 2015, Conference Track Proceedings, edited by Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun. http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473.\n\n\nLuong, Thang, Hieu Pham, and Christopher D.

    "text": "11.2 Building Your Own LLM (in 3 easy steps)\n\n11.2.1 Scrape the Internet\nDatasets typically include everything you can find on the Internet. Exact details, especially for competitive models, are usually not widely shared (remember that Open AI is NOT open). Sometimes you will get something like books, 2TB or social media conversations (?!?).\nContrary to openAI, Meta released their LLaMA models to the research community and is giving some details about their training:\n\n\n\nDataset\nSampling prop.\nEpochs\nDisk size\n\n\n\n\nCommonCrawl\n67.0%\n1.10\n3.3 TB\n\n\nC4\n15.0%\n1.06\n783 GB\n\n\nGithub\n4.5%\n0.64\n328 GB\n\n\nWikipedia\n4.5%\n2.45\n83 GB\n\n\nBooks\n4.5%\n2.23\n85 GB\n\n\nArXiv\n2.5%\n1.06\n92 GB\n\n\nStackExchange\n2.0%\n1.03\n78 GB\n\n\n\nBasically you’ll need a few terabytes of text from the internet.\n\n\n11.2.2 Tokenisation\nWords then need to be mapped into vectors. Obviously the English vocabulary is just too big (with millions of potential tokens).\nThe strategy is usually to reduce the vocabulary size to something small (eg. GPT3’s vocabulary size is only 50257). Words that are not in the initial dictionary (Out-of-Vocabulary words) are encoded by combination of smaller tokens. Typically this is done with algorithms such as byte-pair encoding or WordPiece tokenisation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; vocab = [\"[UNK]\", \"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\", \".\"]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; inputs = \"The quick brown fox.\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = keras_nlp.tokenizers.WordPieceTokenizer(\n...     vocabulary=vocab, lowercase=True)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; outputs = tokenizer(inputs)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; np.array(outputs)\narray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], dtype=int32)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\n\nKeras doc on WordPiece tokenization\nhuggingface course on WordPiece tokenization\nKeras doc Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization\nhuggingface course on Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Architecture: All You Need is Attention\nAs we have seen, LLMs are no more than gigantic Transformer models.\nThere are different flavours of these models, depending on how much encoder or decoder they use. But, these are mostly minor variations. Basically there is nothing really different from what you’ve learned in this module.\n\n\n11.2.4 Training: All You Need is 6,000 GPUs and $2M\n\n\n\nYear\nModel\nParameters\nestimated cost\nnumber of GPUs\n\n\n\n\n2019\nGPT-2\n1.5B\n$50k\n\n\n\n2023\nLLaMA\n70B\n$2m\n6,000\n\n\n2023\nGPT-2\n1.5B\n$8m\n\n\n\n\nBuilding state-of-the-art AI systems requires significant amount of computing resources, data, and thus money. This explains why, since 2014, most significant machine learning models were released by the Industry. AI has long entered an era of corporate control.\n\n\n11.2.5 Fine-Tuning: Training the Assistant Model\nOut-of-the-box trained LLMs are not necessarily very useful in their completions as they are not trained to follow user instructions.\nHere is an example of the answers of a freshly trained GPT-3:\n[Prompt]: Explain the moon landing to a 6 year old in a few sentences.\n\n[GPT-3 completions]:\n\nExplain the theory of gravity to a 6 year old.\n\nExplain the theory of relativity to a 6 year old in a few sentences.\n\nExplain the big bang theory to a 6 year old.\n\nExplain evolution to a 6 year old.\n\nThey had to design a fine-tuned assistant network (InstructGPT) to solve that problem:\n[InstructGPT completion]:\nPeople went to the moon, and they took pictures of what they saw, and sent them\nback to the earth so we could all see them.\n\nSee original post from OpenAI.\nNot all LLMs adopt the same strategy. In GPT-3, OpenAI uses Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\nHumans are asked to rank (lots) of results. These rankings are then used to score outputs. The scores are then used to train a reward/preference model, which, in turn, is used to fine-tune the original model through a reinforcement learning update (eg. PPO).\nSo, not only you need 6,000 GPUs and $2M, you also need to hire thousands of humans to fine-tune the base model into an assistant.\nSee Also\n\n\n11.2.6 Summary: How to Make a Multi-Billion Dollar Company\n\nPre-Train a LLM:\n\nGet your hand on 10k+ GPUs and pay dozens of million dollars.\nScrape terabytes of data from the Internet (don’t say how).\nTrain a baseline Transformer model for weeks.\n\nFine-Tune the Assistant Model:\n\nDesign hundreds of thousands of prompts.\nHire a whole bunch of people to rank the model’s answers.\nFine-tune base model (for a couple of hours/days).\nRun benchmarks and tests to make sure your model is not going to generate text that’s going to destroy your reputation.\nRepeat Steps 2.1-2.4 a couple of times.\n\n\nAt last, deploy, make outrageous claims about general AI, self-awareness and repeat every six months.",

Prompt engineering has become a skill that can greatly improve the quality of the results.\n\n11.3.3.1 Zero-Shot\nFor instance, one specificity of Large LMs is their ability to do zero-shot or few-shots learning.\nWith Zero-Shot you just describe the task, without any example:\n[prompt]:  Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive.\n\nText: I think the vacation is okay.\n\nSentiment:\n\n[output]: neutral\nThis can work for a number of simple tasks.\n\n\n11.3.3.2 Few-Shot\nFor more complex tasks, providing one or multiple examples can improve the output quality. Here is an example:\n[prompt]: A ``whatpu'' is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An \nexample of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is:\nWe were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus.\nTo do a ``farduddle'' means to jump up and down really fast. An example of \na sentence that uses the word farduddle is:\n\n[output]: When we won the game, we all started to farduddle in celebration.\n\n\n11.3.3.3 Chain-of-Thought\nOther prompt techniques exist. Introduced in Wei et al. (2022), chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting allows to further improve the results on more complex tasks.\nAn example of Zero-shot entry, which is failing:\n[prompt]: \n  Q) A juggler can juggle 16 balls. half of the balls are golf balls and \n     half of the balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?\n  A) The answer (arabic numbers) is\n\n[output]: \n8\nNow add CoT to that entry:\n[prompt]: \n  Q) A juggler can juggle 16 balls. half of the balls are golf balls and \n     half of the balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?\n  A) Let's think step by step\n\n[output]: \nThere are 16 balls in total. half of the balls are golf balls. \nThat means that there are 8 golf balls. Half of the golf balls are blue.\nThat means that there are 4 blue golf balls.\nWe can see that asking the LLM to slow down and explain its thought process improves the result.\n\n\n11.3.3.4 Tree-of-Thoughts\nThis idea can be extended with the idea of Tree-of-Thoughts, which can be declinated into a simple prompting hack (see here):\nImagine three different experts are answering this question.\nAll experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,\nthen share it with the group.\nThen all experts will go on to the next step, etc.\nIf any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.\nThe question is...\nOther prompt engineering techniques can be found at https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/",

    "text": "11.4 Emergent Features\nInterestingly, zero-shot and few-shots are abilities that are specific to large LMs. They start to appear only for very large networks.\nThis is called an emergent feature. As models become larger, researchers have started to report that other abilities from the trained model are only present after some threshold has been reached. These abilities are often unexpected and discovered after training.\nThe acquisition of these abilities also correspond to sudden jumps in the performance of the LLMs.\nObserved emergent abilities include the ability to perform arithmetic, answering questions, summarising passages, making spatial representation of board games, etc. All that just by learning how to predict text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1\n\n\n\n\n11.4.1 Emergent Features: An Illusion of Scale?\nNot all are convinced though. Maybe it is all an optical illusion, due to the chosen metric. In Fig@ref(fig:emergent-features-or-not), it is shown how the choice of performance metric can change our perception of gradual or abrupt the emergence of these features can be. In this example the prompt provides a sequence of emojis nad ask what movie it corresponds to (in this case the film finding Nemo). On the left we look at whether the output matches the string finding Nemo, on the right, we evaluate the performance with an MCQ-type exercise. Whereas the LLM seems to make some gradual progress with the MCQ assessment, it needs to pass some threshold before it can outputs finding Nemo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: see https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615\n\n\n\nGradual or not, these features only become visible in the prompt only after some threshold has been reached. So, in a sense the perception of a sudden gap is accurate.\nAll this is still murky waters and not all researchers agree on the matter. These models are still essentially black boxes, and their probabilistic nature is not helping. So, any interpretation about these models is a bit of a can of worms. The perspective of a sentient AI makes this whole debate a very heated topic of conversation.",

    "text": "11.5 The Future of LLMs\n\n11.5.1 Scaling Laws\nIn the near future, it is certain that the size of these networks will continue to grow. Recent research seem to indicate that the performance of LLMs is a predictable function of the number of parameters in the network N, and the size of the training set D. In (Hoffmann et al. 2022) (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) they suggest that performance of Loss can be predicted (regressed) as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{Loss}(N,D) = E + \\frac{A}{N^{\\alpha}} + \\frac{B}{D^{\\beta}},\n\\end{equation} with A, B, E, \\alpha, \\beta some constants.\nIt remains to be seen whether these predictions will stand the test of time, but they, nevertheless, suggest that better intelligence could be achieved by simply scaling models and their training sets (ie. by just throwing more money at it).\nSo, the trend of ever larger models will probably continue in the near future.\nEasy access to large, high quality, training sets is, however, already starting to be become problematic. We already have Wikipedia in our training sets. It is not sure that adding the whole of Twitter will improve the quality of the training data. Also, it won’t be too long before the large amount of content produced by LLMs and that can be found in the wild starts contaminating the training data.\nFinally, public institutions are starting to try to regulate usage of training data (see EU AI Act).\n\n\n11.5.2 Artificial Generate Intelligence\nOn the topic of Future of AI, there are a lot of non-scientific debates around LLMs and AI. This is where the frontier is and everybody is well aware of this. There are philosophical debates about how to qualify this form of intelligence. This is clearly a hot topic that is guaranteed to generate heated debates with your friends.\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the threshold where an agent can accomplish any intellectual task that human beings or animals can perform.\nThere are good reason to believe that LLMs, maybe combined with some Reinforcement Learning (eg. the kind of AI used by Deep Mind in game simulations), could achieve some level of intelligence that surpasses most tasks that human can perform.\nBut as of Nov 26th 2023, we are not there yet.\nThings might change by Nov 27th.\n\n\n11.5.3 The Future of LLMs: Climate Change\nAI is both helping and harming the environment.\nIt is helping because of the optimisation and automation it can provide.\nOn the other hand, the AI Index 2023 Annual Report by Stanford University, estimates that OpenAI’s GPT-3 has released nearly 502 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions during its training. (yes, 4C16 is not great either).\nAlso, the cost of inference, is not insignificant. Research from (de Vries 2023) (see paper) suggests 3-4 Wh per LLM interaction. That’s 564 MWh per day for OpenAI to support ChatGPT.\nThis explains why AI startups are struggling to make a profit, and that a request to ChatGPT 4 is not free.",

    "text": "A.1 Takeaways\nAs we have seen in the handout on Least Squares, there is a very fundamental link between the distribution of the prediction error and the type of loss function you should consider.\nVery early on, Gauss connected Least squares with the principles of probability and to the Gaussian distribution.\nRecall that the linear model is: \\begin{equation}\n  \\mathbf {y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n\\end{equation}\nThe error \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} is the random variable that embodies the uncertainty of the model and explains the differences between the prediction {\\bf x}_i^{\\top}{\\bf w} and the outcome y_i.\nLet’s assume that the error follows a Gaussian distribution, i.e. that \\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2). \\begin{equation}\np({\\varepsilon}_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{{\\varepsilon_i}^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\end{equation}\nWe can measure the likelihood to have y_i given {\\bf x}_i. It is given by: \\begin{equation}\np(y_i|{\\bf x}_i, {\\bf w}) = p(\\varepsilon_i =  {\\bf x}_i^{\\top}{\\bf w}  - y_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\mathrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{({\\bf x}_i^{\\top}{\\bf w}  - y_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\end{equation} Assuming independence of the error terms \\epsilon_i, the combined likelihood to have all outputs {\\bf y} given all data {\\bf X} is given by\n\\begin{aligned}\np({\\bf y}|{\\bf X}, {\\bf w}) &= \\prod_{i=1}^n  p(\\varepsilon_i)\\\\ %= \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\mathrm{exp}\\left(-\\frac{{\\varepsilon}_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\\\\n&=   \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\right)^n   \\mathrm{exp}\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{ \\left({\\bf x}_i^{\\top}{\\bf w}  - y_i\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\nThe maximum likelihood estimate \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\textbf{w}}}_{ML} is simply the weight vector {\\bf w} that maximises the likelihood p({\\bf y}|{\\bf\n  X}, {\\bf w}):\n\\begin{equation}\n\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\textbf{w}}}_{ML} = \\arg\\max_{\\bf w}\np({\\bf y}|{\\bf X}, {\\bf w})\n\\end{equation}\nA more practical, but equivalent, approach is to minimise the negative log likelihood:\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\textbf{w}}}_{ML} &= \\arg\\min_{\\bf w}\n- \\mathrm{log}\\left(p({\\bf y}|{\\bf X}, {\\bf w})\\right) \\\\\n&= \\arg\\min_{\\bf w}  \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left({\\bf\n    x}_i^{\\top}{\\bf w}  - y_i\\right)^2  - n \\mathrm{log}\\left(\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\arg\\min_{\\bf w}   \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left({\\bf x}_i^{\\top}{\\bf w}  - y_i\\right)^2\n\\end{aligned}\nThus we’ve shown that the Least Square estimate is in fact the Maximum Likelihood solution if the error is assumed to be Gaussian.\nNow, let’s assume that the error follows a Laplace distribution:\n\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathrm{Laplace}(0, \\lambda). \\begin{equation}\np({\\varepsilon}_i) = \\frac{1}{2 \\lambda}\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{ |{\\varepsilon_i}| }{\\lambda}\\right)\n\\end{equation}\nAssuming independence of the error terms \\epsilon_i, the combined likelihood to have all outputs {\\bf y} given all data {\\bf X} is this time given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\np({\\bf y}|{\\bf X}, {\\bf w}) &= \\prod_{i=1}^n  p(\\varepsilon_i)\\\\\n&=   \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}\\right)^n   \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sum_{i=1}^n | {\\bf\n    x}_i^{\\top}{\\bf w}  - y_i | \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nFrom which we can derive that minimising the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss is identical to finding the maximum likelihood solution, if the error follows a Laplace distribution.\nNote that solving for the MAE loss is typically tricky. Convex optimisation techniques have been developed in the 2000s to solve for these kind of problems. The mathematics involved are beyond the scope of this module.\nThe loss function is intimately related to the distribution of your errors. This can give us a way to check that we are using an appropriate loss function. Say you use Least Squares to find the Mean Square Error minimiser {\\bf\nw}_{MSE}. If you compute the prediction errors for {\\bf w}_{MSE}, you can then build a histogram of these errors and check that it is indeed close enough to a Gaussian distribution. If the error is far from Gaussian, it may be a good idea to use different loss function, or to go back to the dataset and remove any possible spurious outlier.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Universal approximation theorem (Hornik, 1991) says that ‘’a single hidden layer neural network with a linear output unit can approximate any continuous function arbitrarily well, given enough hidden units’’. The result applies for sigmoid, tanh and many other hidden layer activation functions.\nThe aim of this note is to provide an indication of why this is the case. To make things easier, we are going to look at 1D functions x \\mapsto f(x), and show that the theorem holds for binary neurons. Binary neurons are neuron units for which the activation is a simple threshold, i.e. [{\\bf\n    x}^{\\top}{\\bf w} \\geq 0]. In our case with a 1D input:\n\\begin{equation}\n  x \\mapsto [ xw_1 + w_0 \\geq 0] = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } xw_1 + w_0 \\geq\n    0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nWe use binary neurons but the idea can be extended to multiple inputs and different activation functions (eg. ReLU, sigmoid, etc.).\nThe argument starts with the observation that any given continuous function f can be approximated by a discretisation as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\tilde{f}(x) \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i) [ x_i \\leq x &lt; x_{i+1}]\\,,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere x \\mapsto [ x_i \\leq x &lt; x_{i+1}] is a pulse function that is 1 only in the interval [x_i, x_{i+1}[ and zero outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure B.1: Discretisation of the function x \\mapsto f(x) over the interval [x_0, x_4].\n\n\n\nThe trick is that this pulse can be modelled as the addition of two binary neuron units (see Figure B.2):\n\\begin{equation}\n      [ x_i \\leq x &lt; x_{i+1}] = [ x - x_{i}\\geq 0] - [ x - x_{i+1} \\geq 0]\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure B.2: Modelling a pulse with two binary neurons.\n\n\n\nWe can substitute this for all the pulses: \\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n      f(x) &\\approx \\sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i) \\left( [ x \\geq x_{i}] - [ x \\geq\n        x_{i+1}] \\right)\\\\\n        &\\approx f(x_0) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(f(x_i) -\n        f(x_{i-1})\\right) [ x \\geq x_{i}]\n\\end{aligned}   \n\\end{equation}\nThe network corresponding to the discretisation of Figure B.1 is illustrated in Figure B.3 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure B.3: Neural Network for the discretisation of the function x \\mapsto f(x) over the interval [x_0, x_4].",

    "title": "Appendix C — Why Does L_1 Regularisation Induce Sparsity?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "C.1 L_2 Regularisation\nIn machine learning, a model is described as being sparse when many of its learned parameters (or weights) are exactly zero. Consider a linear regression model:\n\\begin{equation}\n  y = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\dots + w_p x_p.\n\\end{equation}\nImagine a scenario where we have a large number of features, but we suspect that only a small subset of them are truly predictive of the output. If we train a standard regression model, it will likely assign a non-zero weight to every feature. The weights for irrelevant features might be small, but they will rarely be exactly zero. This makes the model difficult to interpret and less efficient.\nSparsity is desirable because it effectively performs automatic feature selection. By driving the weights of irrelevant features to zero, a sparse model reveals which features are most important. This leads to simpler, more interpretable, and often more robust models.\nThe question, then, is how to encourage a model to learn sparse solutions. While one could manually set small weights to zero after training, this is an ad-hoc approach. A more principled method is to incorporate regularisation into the loss function during training. By adding a penalty term that depends on the magnitude of the weights, we can influence the optimisation process to favour sparsity.\nHowever, not all regularisers are created equal. This note explains why L_1 regularisation is effective at inducing sparsity, while the more common L_2 regularisation is not. We will demonstrate this for a single weight parameter, w, but the argument generalises to higher dimensions.\nThe core of the argument lies in how the regularisation term alters the shape of the loss function, E(w), near the origin. For a weight to be optimally zero, the regularised loss function must have a minimum at w=0. Figure C.1 shows a typical loss function where the minimum is at some non-zero value, \\hat{w}=0.295. Let us see how adding regularisation can shift this minimum to zero.\nLet us first examine L_2 regularisation. The regularised loss function, E_2(w), is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\n  E_2(w) = E(w) + \\lambda_2 \\frac{1}{2} w^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\lambda_2 &gt; 0 is the regularisation strength. As shown in Figure C.2, increasing \\lambda_2 pulls the minimum of the loss function closer to zero. However, as Figure Figure C.3 reveals, the optimal weight \\hat{w} approaches zero asymptotically but never actually reaches it (unless it was already zero to begin with).\nTo understand why, let us analyse the function near w=0 using a Taylor expansion of the original loss, E(w):\n\\begin{equation}\n  E(w) \\approx E(0) + \\frac{dE}{dw}(0) w +\n  \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2E}{dw^2}(0) w^2\n\\end{equation}\nThe regularised loss is therefore:\n\\begin{equation}\n  E_2(w) \\approx E(0) + \\frac{dE}{dw}(0) w +\n  \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{d^2E}{dw^2}(0) + \\lambda_2 \\right) w^2\n\\end{equation}\nFor a minimum to exist at w=0, the first derivative of the loss function must be zero at that point. The derivative of E_2(w) is:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\frac{dE_2}{dw}(w) \\approx \\frac{dE}{dw}(0) + \\left( \\frac{d^2E}{dw^2}(0) + \\lambda_2 \\right) w\n\\end{equation}\nAt w=0, this becomes:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\frac{dE_2}{dw}(0) = \\frac{dE}{dw}(0).\n\\end{equation}\nThe L_2 penalty is thus a smooth function (w^2), and its derivative at w=0 is zero. Consequently, the L_2 penalty cannot change the gradient of the loss function at the origin. If the original loss function had a non-zero gradient at w=0 (which it typically does, as seen in Figure C.1), the regularised loss will have the exact same gradient at that point. Therefore, w=0 cannot be a minimum.\nNote that L_2 still has the effect of pulling the minimum closer to zero. Indeed, a new minimum will occur where \\frac{dE_2}{dw}(w) = 0, ie. for:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\hat{w} = -\\frac{\\frac{dE}{dw}(0)}{\\frac{d^2E}{dw^2}(0) + \\lambda_2 }.\n\\end{equation}\nFrom this expression, we can see that as \\lambda_2 \\rightarrow \\infty, \\hat{w} \\rightarrow 0. The weight is indeed shrunk towards zero, but never becomes exactly zero. Thus, L_2 regularisation cannot induce sparsity.",

    "text": "C.2 L_1 Regularisation\nNow, let us consider L_1 regularisation. The regularised loss is:\n\\begin{equation}\n  E_1(w) = E(w) + \\lambda_1 |w|.\n\\end{equation}\nAs shown in Figure C.4 and Figure C.5, the effect of the L_1 penalty is qualitatively different. As \\lambda_1 increases, the minimum not only moves closer to zero but, for \\lambda_1 &gt; 0.4058, it snaps to become exactly zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure C.4: L_1 regularised loss function E_1(w) for different values of \\lambda_1.’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure C.5: Corresponding estimated weight values for different values of \\lambda_1.’\n\n\n\nThe key difference lies in the penalty term |w|. Unlike w^2, the absolute value function is not smooth at the origin; it has a sharp “kink”. This means its derivative is discontinuous at w=0. Let us examine the derivative of the regularised loss, E_1(w):\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\frac{dE_1}{dw}(w) = \\frac{dE}{dw}(w) + \\lambda_1 \\cdot \\text{sgn}(w),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\text{sgn}(w) is the sign function, which is +1 for w&gt;0 and -1 for w&lt;0. For a minimum to exist at w=0, the gradient must be positive for w \\rightarrow 0^+ and negative for w \\rightarrow 0^-. Let us check these conditions using a first-order Taylor expansion of E(w) around zero:\nFor w=0 to be a local minimum, we need the slope to be negative just to the left of zero and positive just to the right. This means we need:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dE}{dw}(0) - \\lambda_1 &lt; 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dE}{dw}(0) + \\lambda_1 &gt; 0\n\\end{equation}\nThese two conditions can be combined into a single one:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\lambda_1 &gt; \\left| \\frac{dE}{dw}(0)  \\right|.\n\\end{equation}\nSo, unlike the L_2 case, the L_1 penalty introduces a constant force, \\lambda_1, that pulls the weight towards zero. If this force is stronger than the gradient of the original loss function at the origin, |\\frac{dE}{dw}(0)|, then the optimal solution for the weight becomes exactly zero. This is why L_1 regularisation induces sparsity.",

    "text": "C.3 Takeaways\nThe ability of L_1 regularisation to produce sparse models stems from the sharp, non-differentiable “kink” in the absolute value function at the origin. This creates a constant penalty gradient that can overcome the gradient of the loss function, forcing weights to become exactly zero.\nIn contrast, the L_2 penalty is smooth (differentiable) at the origin and its gradient is zero at that point. It therefore cannot create a minimum at zero unless one already existed. It shrinks weights towards zero but does not perform feature selection in the same way as L_1.\nThis concept can be generalised to the L_p norm, defined as \\|w\\|_p = (\\sum_i |w_i|^p)^{1/p}. Regularisers with p \\le 1 (like L_1) induce sparsity, while those with p &gt; 1 (like L_2) do not.",
